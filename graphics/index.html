<h1>Bob-omb Raytracing</h1>

<p style="font-style: italic">This is a description of the objectives I completed for my CS 488 Computer Graphics final project. The end goal was to replicate the following image:</p>

<img src="final-scene.jpg" />

<h2>Objective 1: Additional primitives</h2>

<img src="primitives.png" />

<h2>Objective 2: Constructive solid geometry</h2>

<div class="smaller">
<img src="csg.png" />
</div>

<p>These objects are constructive solid geometry of a cylinder with a sphere. The top row is union, the second is intersection, and the bottom two are differences.</p>

<h2>Objective 3: Bob-omb modeled</h2>

<img src="model.png"/>

<p>The models were made using a combination of the primitives with constructive solid geometry.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The eyes are toruses unioned with the main body</li>

  <li>The beige fuse is a torus with cubes differenced to cut off parts of it</li>

  <li>The grey blasting cap is a cylinder intersected with a cone, differenced with another cylinder at the top of the cone</li>

  <li>The wind up key is two cylinders unioned with a cube, with two smaller cylinders differenced inside</li>

  <li>The feet are toruses differenced with cubes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Objective 3, 4, 7: Texture mapping, reflection</h2>

<p>The other half of objective 3 was modeling the tree seen in the reflection. Since a polygonal mesh of a tree would be too costly, I did it by texture mapping a planar mesh and putting it behind the camera in a way that didn't block the light source / cast shadows. The effect didn't turn out as well as I hoped, so it is not included in my final render.</p>

<div class="comparison">
  <img src="texture-back.png" />
  <img src="texture-reflect.png" />
</div>

<h2>Objective 5: Anti-aliasing</h2>

<p>I implemented anti-aliasing with 3x3 regular supersampling (image on the right). The left is the original for comparison.</p>

<div class="comparison">
  <img src="nonhier-before.png" />
  <img src="nonhier-aa.png" />
</div>

<h2>Objective 6: Soft shadows</h2>

<p>Soft shadows were done through distributed ray tracing with 36 stochastic rays.</p>

<div class="comparison">
  <img src="nonhier-before.png" />
  <img src="nonhier-ss.png" />
</div>

<h2>Objective 7: Reflection</h2>

<div class="comparison">
  <img src="nonhier-before.png" />
  <img src="nonhier-reflect.png" />
</div>

<h2>Objective 8: Glossy reflection</h2>

<div class="comparison">
  <img src="nonhier-before.png" />
  <img src="nonhier-gloss.png" />
</div>

<h2>Objective 10: Final scene</h2>

<p>Combining everything, below is my rendering of the scene. Total render time: 5 hours 10 minutes, multithreaded on 4 cores.</p>

<img src="scene.png" />

<h2>Extra Objective: Multi-threading</h2>

<img src="macho-cows.png" />

<p>Since I wasn't able to implement grid partitioning (objective 9), I instead implemented multithreading to accelerate my raytracing. Below is a graph comparing the time it took to render the macho-cows image with anti-aliasing turned on for differing numbers of threads.</p>
