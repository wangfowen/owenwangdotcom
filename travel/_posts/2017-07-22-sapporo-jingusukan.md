Place: Sapporo Beer Garden

Can't come to the city and not have the beer! This place is great to visit.

Food: Jingisukan and Sapporo Five Star

Jingisukan is a specialty in the winter here. It's pronounced "Ghenghis Khan" and is named after the person. It's a lamb barbecue and pairs extremely well with the beer.
