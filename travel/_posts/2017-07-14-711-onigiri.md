Place: 7/11 in Japan

We average at least one a day whenever we visit. Seriously so convenient and the food is so good, nothing like the 7/11 in North America. Here you can pay for Amazon purchases, get packages ordered there, there's an ATM, and other actually convenient services. Also seriously the most tender fried chicken.

Food: Onigiri

The packaging is so thoughtful and well made on these, if you follow the steps to unfold, you end up being able to hold it without getting your hands dirty, and the rice and seaweed would have been separated until you unfolded it so that the seaweed doesn't get soggy. Very innovative.
