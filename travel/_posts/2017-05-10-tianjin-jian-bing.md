Place: Tianjin

Visiting my mom's side of the family. Technically we're in the outskirts, but here too the growth has been tremendous. China is really changing fast.

Food: Jian Bing Guo Zi (煎饼果子)

A specialty here. A crepe with an egg, some sauce, and something crunchy in the middle. Sometimes you'd get other toppings like sausage or potatoes. Delicious no matter how you make it.
