Place: Thukla

A tiny town with just two restaurants and lodges. This place basically exists because of tourism. In fact, tourism supports most of the living here. People here live in poverty unless someone in the family works in tourism. It used to be the case that trade was big but then tensions between China and India made this trade route not as friendly.

Food: Yak Steak

Sweet, gamey taste. Soft texture, less tough than I expected. Yaks are extremely important to the ecosystem here. They can carry supplies that are too heavy for people to carry themselves. Their fur allows them to survive the cold weather and every part of them - fur, milk, meat, even dung - gets used.
