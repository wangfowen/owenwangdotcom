Place: Asahikawa

Second biggest city in Hokkaido. Honestly we stopped here because it was mentioned in Food Wars...

Food: Soup Curry

A specialty in Hokkaido. Like curry but not as thick, meant to be drunk. This place had spice level 0-50 where "3 is medium". We did not dare try anything near 50.
