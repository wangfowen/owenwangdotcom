Place: Shakotan

There is basically nothing in this tiny village. We drove here exclusively for the food.

Food: Red uni don at Misaki

We woke up at 5am to drive an hour and 30 minutes to get here an hour before opening to get our names on the list. By the time we arrived, there were already 20 people on the list! This place only serves 15 bowls of the red uni per day, and it's only open from June to August. The restaurant is owned by a family of fishermen and they fish the uni fresh the morning of at 4am. Thankfully not everyone in line ahead of us ordered the red uni don so we got some! It was as amazing as we had hoped, well worth the drive.
