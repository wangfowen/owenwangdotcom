Place: Chitwan National Park

Halfway between Pokhara and Kathmandu. Lots of wildlife, worth a visit. Getting there is hilarious. Bumpiest roads ever, and that's the biggest highway through Nepal. I never get car sick yet felt some nausea on the way there. They're trying to fix the roads, there's closures everyday from 10am-4pm, so if you arrive at the cross point at even 10:01, you're stuck waiting there til 4pm.

Food: Weird Pringles flavors
Cans are smaller, made for Nepali hands. Chips are smaller too. Cheeseburger tasted exactly like cheeseburger, despite being vegetarian. Green curry a bit of coconut and lime flavors
