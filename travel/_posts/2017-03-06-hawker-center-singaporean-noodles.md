Place: A hawker center

First stop of our trip! Open air food complexes like these are very common around Singapore, Malaysia, and Hong Kong. Huge variety of food stalls for you to choose from. Interestingly, most of these stalls are right next to their respective restaurants. The food is cooked in the stall and you can then eat it in the restaurant if you so choose.

Food: Singaporean noodles

I don’t have much to say about the noodles… I wanted to get a photo of chicken rice instead, but we ate it before I remembered to do this. Chicken rice was highly recommended by everyone I know that went on exchange in Singapore. Basically rice cooked in chicken stock served with chicken. Very chicken as you would expect.
