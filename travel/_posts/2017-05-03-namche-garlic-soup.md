Place: Namche

This is the last big city people can fly supplies to before basecamp. Flying is expensive though so most supplies are transported by porters. Almost all of them that we saw carried massive bags of goods via their head. The weight is primarily behind them like a backpack, but the strap goes over their forehead like a hat. The ergonomics don't look great, but if it works for them, it works.

The hike from Phakding to here, we were literally walking through clouds, never seen anything like it.

Food: Garlic Soup

Apparently this is good for altitude, prevents you from getting sick. Either way it was delicious
