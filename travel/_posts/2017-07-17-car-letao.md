Place: our car for two weeks around Hokkaido

Driving here is not as hard as we thought it'd be! You get used to driving on the left pretty fast, and people are not nearly as aggressive on the road as in North America. Perhaps to be expected.

Food: Le Tao Cheesecake
So soft and creamy. Hokkaido milk will be a consistent theme of epicness throughout this trip I'm sure
