Place: Jining, Shandong

Visiting my dad's side of the family! This place has changed so much throughout the years. It used to be a very rural village but now it has grown into a tier 3 city.

Food: Soup

In Shandong, instead of asking "Did you eat yet?" people ask "Did you drink soup yet?" as their way of showing care. Every meal always ends with soup, often a noodle soup. Having not been back for a while, I always forgot to budget room for it, but it was rude to not finish it so I would regardless.
