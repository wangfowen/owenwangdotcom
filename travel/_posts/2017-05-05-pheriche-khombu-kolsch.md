Place: Pheriche

First day of our descent. Going up, once you get into altitude, you should only go 500m at a time, but going down you can go as fast as you want. In Pheriche there's a large medical facility and yak farms

Food: Khombu Kolsch

This was my favorite beer thus far. A german style craft beer, nice dark flavors.
