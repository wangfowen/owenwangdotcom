Place: Elephant Breeding Center
Female elephants are chained down for males to come mate with them. Pretty screwed up, but this increases the elephant population and helps people learn again how to work with elephants, so we're told.

Food: Elephant Momo
Technically is food! Except it's for the elephants. Giant ball of leaves with rice, sugar, and salt inside. Funny that they named it the same as the dumplings people eat here.
