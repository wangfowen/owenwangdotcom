Place: Harajuku

One of the touristy areas of Tokyo. If you want to be a classic tourist, here you can find hedge hog cafes, owl cafes, maid cafes, etc.

Food: Cremia

Still my favorite ice cream out of all that I've ever had. Cannot recommend this enough. It's made from 12% Hokkaido milk. So silky smooth
