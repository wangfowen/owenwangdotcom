Place: Haldiram’s

A sweets and snacks chain. This place was seriously packed. It even had a metal detector / security at the front – this apparently is a thing anywhere that has high people density and is a result of the bombings that happened in Mumbai a couple years back. Inside it’s chaotic, but essentially you pay up front and get a receipt for your items, then you go up to the various counters to get your goods. Quite different of a system than other places I’ve eaten. Everything we got tasted awesome :)

Food: Pani puri

Aka gol gappa in North India, aka phuchhka in East India. A crunchy flour shell with some sort of liquidy mint chutney, potato and chickpea salad, and a sweet red sauce inside.
