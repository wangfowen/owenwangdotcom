Place: Shops outside Nokha Likai Falls

Decided to take an alternative path back up from Nongriat. This one a 3 hour hike up towards Nokha Likai Falls. What we didn’t anticipate was that shortly after starting our hike it’d be pouring out… Even at 9am, the rain clouds filling in the gaps of the jungle canopy made it look like it was night out. Every time lightning struck, the thunder would roar continuously for a minute, reverberating through the forest. I’d never heard anything like it before. I think this is where the term rolling thunder came from. By the end of the hike, we were so soaked and cold I could barely feel my hands. Good prep for Everest though.

Food: Banana

A crazy looking banana. There are several species of bananas here that look nothing like the ones back home. This one was twice as thick and straight. Another we had was tiny and had seeds inside!!

Nothing like a burst of sugar and starch to recover from a long trek.
