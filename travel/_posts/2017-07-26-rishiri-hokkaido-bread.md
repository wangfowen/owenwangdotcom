Place: Mount Rishiri

1721m hike to the top of the mountain, supposed to get a 360 view of the mountain but ended up being too cloudy to see anything from most of the view.

Food: Hokkaido Milk Bread

Half the food we eat at convenience stores is sandwiches. What makes the sandwiches so magical is the bread. It tastes even softer, sweeter, and moister than Wonderbread. People here don't seem to be a fan of whole grain.
