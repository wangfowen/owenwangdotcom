Place: Wang Wang Chinese Restaurant

We made our way back to Yangon for the Water Festival and of course one of the only restaurants open during that time is a Chinese restaurant. And of course at a Chinese restaurant, when you have a large group like ours, you get your own private room with a revolving table.

We decided to go full Chinese and get a large case of beers. Not many of us actually wanted to drink though, but Alice bet us 5:1 odds we couldn’t finish it so we had to… Needless to say hilarity ensued.

Food: Myanmar beer

In Myanmar, the only brand of beer is Myanmar. It’s supposedly a lager but frankly it tasted more like a pilsner. Very light and refreshing, one of the tastier beers I’ve had on this trip.
