Place: Momoiwa Hostel in Rebun

This place is an absolute must visit if you get the chance. I don't want to say too much in fear of ruining it. But it was so unexpected of an experience. Several people we met there have visited many times because they loved it so much.

Food: Natto

Andrew's face is what eating natto looks like. I still cannot understand this dish.
