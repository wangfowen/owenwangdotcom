Place: Nakafurano

This town is known for lavender fields. Very pretty views from the hills.

Food: Lavender soft serve

Each area in Hokkaido has its own flavor of soft serve. Might get diabetes from how much sugar consuming but it's all so delicious... And once again, this is made from the incredible Hokkaido milk so it tastes so soft and silky
