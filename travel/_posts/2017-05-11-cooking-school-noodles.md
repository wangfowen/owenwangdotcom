Place: Cooking School in Beijing

I spent two weeks here learning how to make Sichuan and Cantonese food. It was a phenomenal experience that I'd recommend to anyone that can understand a bare minimum amount of Mandarin. The price tag was reasonable and the classes extremely flexible in scheduling.

Food: Hand pulled noodles

Of my two weeks, I spent two days learning hand pulled noodles. This was one of the hardest things I've learned to make. Even after two whole days of class learning it, not even close to mastering the technique still. It's a cool show to put on though if you can do it.
