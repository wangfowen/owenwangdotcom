Place: Thukla
Tiny town, just two restaurants and lodges. Basically exists because of tourism. In fact, tourism supports most of the living here. People in poverty unless someone in family has a member in tourism. Used to be trade was big but then india and china ruined that.

Food: Yak steak
Sweet, gamey taste. Soft texture, less tough than expected
Talk about importance of yaks, mix with cows
