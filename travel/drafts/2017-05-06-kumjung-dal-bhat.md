Place: Kumjung
One more day from the bottom!
Finally got another hot shower after a week. Higher you go the more expensive things get and the less amenities are available. If you plan to do the hike, budget about $25 per day for food and lodging. Expect to not have much. Definitely appreciated a lot of things that were taken for granted before.

Food: Dal Bhat
Dal Bhat power. Free refills, best source of energy after long days of hiking
