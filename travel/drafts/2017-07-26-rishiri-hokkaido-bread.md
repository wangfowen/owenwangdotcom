place: mount rishiri
1721m hike to the top of the mountain, supposed to get a 360 view of the mountain but ended up being too cloudy to see anything from most of the view

food: hokkaido bread
half the food we eat at convenience stores is sandwiches. japanese bread is seriously magical, even better than wonderbread. they don't seem to do whole grain. so soft and moist and sweet
