      <h2>A Brief Stint with Online Dating</h2>

    <div class="post">
    <p>Online dating’s stigma has diminished significantly over the years. That phrase 
used to evoke images of pedophiles and creepers prowling the internet, but now 
it seems all the kids are doing it.</p>

<p>I myself decided to give it a try when one of my best friends told me that he 
found his current girlfriend through it. He’s quite the ladies man so he clearly 
didn’t <em>need</em> online dating. From what I’ve heard the girl sounds like an 
awesome person, not at all a cat lady or whomever you’d expect to find on the 
sites. I didn’t have anything going on so I figured might as well give it a 
shot.</p>

<p>There’s many options when it comes to what site to use (Ashley Madison anyone?).<br />
I went with OKCupid as I recalled their 
<a href="http://blog.okcupid.com/" target="_blank">blog</a> popping up on Hacker News a 
while back. They publish all sorts of hilarious metrics based on data they’ve 
  gathered from users. I didn’t mind becoming another one of their guinea pigs.</p>

<p>OKCupid has done a great job with first-time user experience. It was extremely 
intuitive to set up a profile, and just as simple to start finding matches. They 
even help break the ice by telling the other person when you view their profile, 
essentially provoking you to take action.</p>

<p>The online dating ride was quite a rollercoaster for me (and none of that weak 
Canada’s Wonderland business. Serious stuff like Cedar Point). The first time 
someone messaged me of their own accord, I went berserk with happiness. I didn’t 
understand why someone would do such a thing. The first time I messaged someone 
and they didn’t respond, the first time someone stopped responding after a bit 
of interaction, and all the other situations that ended in dead ends upwelled 
all my insecurities. Am I not good enough? What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>I showed some friends the messages I had sent and they pointed out that I didn’t 
at all sound natural. What I had written sounded nothing like what I’d say in 
real life.</p>

<p>Fastforward a month or so, someone agreed to go on a date with me in real life. 
I did a double take to make sure I didn’t misread and jumped out of my seat and 
did a little dance.</p>

<figure><img src="/images/okc_dance.gif" /><figcaption>I wish I had moves like that</figcaption></figure>

<p>From the overall experience I came to understand that I just had to be myself. I 
know - such a cliché - but some things people tell you over and over and it 
still doesn’t really click til you figure it out yourself. There’s plenty of 
people out there that will appreciate me for being me. There’s really no point 
in getting hung up on the little things. Non-response didn’t necessarily mean I 
did something wrong. It just meant that not everyone out there is looking for 
the same thing, it’s really not a big deal that I didn’t get <em>“chosen”</em> by every 
person out there. Afterall, you just have to find <em>one</em> that does <em>choose</em> you.</p>

<p>I’m sure most of the lessons I learned others have learned through regular 
relationships. I’d like to blame my not having done so on going to an 
engineering school void of girls, but that’s actually not true. I’ve begun to 
put myself out there more now, joining clubs on campus and actually talking to 
people in them. There are girls! They do exist, I promise.</p>

<p>I’ve since deleted my OKCupid account. I figure I’m doing alright meeting people 
from clubs in the meantime; it’s better to not rely on the bootstrapping. Online 
dating certainly helped boost my confidence, grow socially, and get a foot out 
the door in meeting new people. It was an interesting experience and I would 
recommend it to anyone with an open mind. There really is no shame in trying. In 
the end, does it really matter how you met your significant other? It just 
matters that you met them.</p>

<p>An unexpected side effect: you list your body type on the site and I felt guilty 
for listing myself as “average”, as I felt quite out of shape. I wanted to make 
  sure I didn’t disappoint when I met someone in real life so I got back into 
  that exercise-and-eat-healthy diet. Since then I’ve lost 15 pounds, I can 
  run/bench more than I ever could, and for the first time my immune system 
  isn’t completely shot during exams (I guess they’re technically not over yet, 
  so fingers crossed).</p>
