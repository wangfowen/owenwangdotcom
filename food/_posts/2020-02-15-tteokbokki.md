Seems Soon tofu gets its primary flavor from kimchi juice, while tteokbokki gets its flavor from gochujang. I used my homemade vegetable stock for both instead of anchovy juices, roughly following the recipe from [https://www.koreanbapsang.com/tteokbokki-spicy-stir-fried-rice-cakes/](here).

Tteokbokki turned out pretty authentic tasting but too salty, likely because I used a bit too much gochujang. 

Soon tofu didn't quite taste like what we have in the restaurants. I'm lost on how to improve the flavor since I have no basis for what should be in it. Different recipes online all called for different ingredients. Will have to try at a restaurant again with deeper analysis to see what I'm missing.
