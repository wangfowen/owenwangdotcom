__What happened?__

New attempts:

Beets! Half of batch pre-salted and half not. Both had half pre-cut into slices and half left whole. Wrapped in foil and baked with the chicken

Tried and true:

Chicken breast brined overnight, baked at 450F

When I pulled out the chicken, it was registering 140F on the thermometer, but I got lazy so I just packed it as is, figured microwaving would fix it. Turns out that is not the case – even after microwaving it tasted rubbery. Completely inedible.

I baked the rest a second time the next day, this time to 160F, but now the chicken tasted hard and leathery. Turns out you can’t re-bake chicken to attempt same results. 

The beets did not taste that great and were a bit much in such large quantities (each meal I had ~2 whole beets), and some of them were bitter. Also it made everything that exited my body turn red.

__What went well?__

Ended up trying many different experiments in this one batch

__What could go better?__

Basically everything. 

- Cook chicken right the first time
- Mark which beets were in which batch. Some of the ones I ate were bitter but I couldn’t tell which it was from so I don’t have a clear conclusion
- Mix beets with something else instead of just serving it as is. It’s too much on its own for a meal
