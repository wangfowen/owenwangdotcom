Since Ivy wrote about her [reasons and goals in 
leaving](https://medium.com/@ivyxvine/why-im-leaving-san-francisco-ff7b799473ea?fbclid=IwAR27IZejVrP7o3H8bmpCZhgH4YEUaVsCLYQo5_D7bmidPPsPcf-mWmMYTAA){:target="_blank"}, 
I've been told I need to explain myself as well, so here we are. I won't be 
listing any issues I'm finding with San Francisco in this &mdash; don't get me 
wrong, I'm well aware of the host of them, but I've [already 
accepted](/post/imperfection){:target="_blank"} some of the bad is flip sides of 
the good, and the rest are complicated issues slowly being changed. Generally 
I'm still satisfied with life here.

The reality for why I'm doing this is because [I got 
fired](/post/fired){:target="_blank"}. At least that's the direct catalyst. It's 
only been about a year and a half since I came back from a different bout of 
world travels, and we literally just signed a year lease a week prior that cost 
over 5k to break. I honestly did not plan to leave again so soon.

_But this is not an escape from my problems. It's just a matter of timing._

This would likely be the most opportune moment for the two of us to uproot 
together while we're under 30. Ivy was also considering switching jobs when my 
circumstances changed, so practically speaking, we were both untethered 
work-wise. Since we were already preparing to move in together, there was also 
less friction with packing up all our belongings.

__What makes 30 the magical number?__<br/>
There's this thing called a working holiday visa that Canadians can apply for 
(other countries have it in some form as well) that allows them to work and live 
elsewhere while they're under 30 for up to a year in each place. The list of 
elsewheres is [quite 
long](https://www.creditwalk.ca/dear-nora-the-ultimate-working-holiday-visa-guide-for-canadians/){:target="_blank"}, 
another wonderful perk of being Canadian ([sorry 
Americans](https://www.gooverseas.com/post/americans-guide-working-holiday-visas){:target="_blank"}).

__What's the elsewheres you're looking at?__ <br/>
So far we're applying for the New Zealand, Australia, and Japan visas, and we've 
got a one way ticket booked to New Zealand. We may go to all of them, we may 
not, we may also go elsewhere.

The plan is to explore opportunities in each place with a bit of traveling in 
between, and if we tire of a place, move onto the next. There's no set timelines 
right now, we'll see where the wind takes us. 

Let us know if you'd like to visit us somewhere! We'd love to see all your faces 
as we'll surely get tired of each other's. You can hear about location updates 
and more via [our newsletter](http://bit.ly/ivyowen){:target="_blank"} (or by 
contacting us directly of course).

__But why uproot at all? You're already living and working elsewhere aka 
America!__<br/>
The TN visa that allows me to be in America has a couple limitations:
1. I am tied to the company sponsoring my visa. I'm not allowed to make money in 
   any other form outside of my full-time job.
2. I am only allowed to work in the field I studied, which is tech.

I can stay in Canada to avoid these restrictions, but this is a limited time 
opportunity to do the exact same with the added bonus of trying living 
elsewhere. And what's appealing about lifting these restrictions is I can try 
some things I wouldn't be able to otherwise.

Cooking is something that's recently grown from being a mere interest to taking 
up 1-2 nights of my time real estate per week. The world of food completely 
fascinates me. It's both something we consume for sustenance, as well as 
something we derive experiences and pleasures from. It's something that gathers 
people together to socialize, and something that provides insights on the 
socioeconomics, culture, environment, and more of a place and time. Waste and 
climate change are both hugely impacted by how we create and consume it.

With this chance, I could see if anything related to food speaks to me. Given 
what I've learned about 
[life](https://www.bonappetit.com/story/line-cook-nycs-fanciest-restaurants){:target="_blank"} 
[in a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW140spadx8){:target="_blank"} 
[kitchen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitchen_Confidential_(book)){:target="_blank"}, 
it's unlikely I'll pivot to working as a chef from this, but I am interested in 
upping my cooking abilities, gleaning insights on the problems in the industry, 
and gaining a better understanding of the food we put in our body. I could see 
any and all of these paying dividends down the line, whether or not I return to 
tech.

Some opportunities I want to explore are wwoofing, working on a vineyard, 
working in a kitchen, taking cooking classes, working for a catering service, 
and/or visiting manufacturing facilities. If anyone has any other suggestions, 
or has connections with any of these in the places we're going, please shoot 
them my way.

I do have some other back-up ideas that leverage the visa for if I completely 
disavow the industry (or it me) before we're ready to call it quits, but I'm 
leaving those on the back burner for after I've fully explored what I want from 
food.

Last time I became a vagabond, the intent was to immerse myself in other 
cultures, to learn more about the world. I stayed in each place longer than I 
would for a vacation, trying to see more than just the typical tourist sights, 
but I was still essentially touring.

This time the intent is to focus on things I can't here. I intend to do only a 
little touring, mostly working wherever we are. Ivy and I do have different 
goals and hers are more fluid in place, so likely there will be some push and 
pull in the lengths of our stays, but I'm sure we'll find something that works 
for the both of us.

Last time was a pause from regularly scheduled programming. This time regularly 
scheduled programming will continue as before, but the prime time showing of 
Silicon Valley will be replaced with Master Chef.
