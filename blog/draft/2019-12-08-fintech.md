# M-Pesa and the Agency Model

What surprised us most about Kenya was that it felt like we were back in China in many ways. Aside from being a spitting image of a fourth-tier city (like the factory cities Ivy visited) in the greater downtown area, Kenya is incredibly advanced with mobile payments.

In every scenario from paying Uber drivers to tipping tour guides, to buying train tickets to paying a restaurant or a utility bill, everyone uses M-Pesa.

M-Pesa was started by Safaricom, the main telecom company we wrote about in our [previous newsletter](/blog/kenya). It was just intended as a corporate social responsibility project to help with remittances in rural areas, but it took off much more than anticipated.

One of the reasons M-Pesa has succeeded to get Kenyans cashless is the agency model. While you can deposit money online (we used an app called Sendwave built for foreigners), people primarily withdraw and deposit money through designated M-Pesa agents, and agents are _everywhere_.

There are over 160,000 agents countrywide in Kenya. Anyone can apply to be an agent so long as certain requirements of being a business entity are met and you have enough reserve cash. Some people work full time as agents, opening small booths to do so, but what really makes them so prevalent is that all kinds of businesses from gas stations to pharmacies double as M-Pesa agents.

With that many agents across the country, if a grandma in a rural area wants to withdraw money her grandson hustling in the big city sends her, it is more convenient for her to do so via M-Pesa at an agent in the community than to travel miles to the nearest bank. 

The agency model works for developing places like Kenya for two reasons: many people are unbanked (31% of adults worldwide, 20% of Kenyans still), and many people don’t have smartphones (70% of Kenyans). These numbers make agents well suited for the physical transactions necessary to bridge the offline and the online. 

The low smartphone use also explains why M-Pesa’s interface requires you to enter till numbers when making transfers, instead of using QR codes like in China: the interfaces are built to be usable by basic T9 phones as well (remember those?). They also work via USSD, which is like an interactive SMS, instead of being solely internet reliant. This makes it usable for the large populations in slums that only have a cell connection without data access.

The agency model is now being applied to other services like insurance. There are still many possibilities for applying it to other industries, as well as to other countries with similar demographics. Maybe one of our readers will be one to take it on...

# Digital Currencies in the Slums

Along with seeing M-Pesa here, we also got a taste of a different kind of digital currency that’s helping people get banked. Owen has been doing some contract work with a fintech startup, [Sempo](https://withsempo.com/), and one of their partnerships is in Kenya with a non-profit called [Grassroots Economics](https://www.grassrootseconomics.org/) that is empowering marginalized communities to invest in themselves.

They do this by creating a digital “community currency” within these remote villages and slums. Wealth is generally extracted out of these places through the goods and services imported for daily needs. The community currencies are meant to be spent the same as real money with the difference being wealth generated would stay within the communities. They can be cashed out for Kenyan Shillings but with withdrawal limits, so they are essentially real money (what is money actually anyways?). Once enough businesses accept them as a form of payment, there’s no longer a need to cash them out, and new businesses become incentivized to be created to serve the community itself.

With Grassroots, we went to one of the slums in the city, where people live on just $1 a day. Here’s a young man who runs a corn flour mill that accepts Sarafu, the name of the community currency.

We also saw a bootleg CD shop that accepted Sarafu, an example of a service created for the community itself. Because people don't have much access to internet, if you wanted to watch a movie, you can ask them to download it then burn it onto a CD for you.
 
There is no access to running water in the slums, so someone wheels over clean water from the richer areas, sometimes stealing it from the pipes, sometimes buying it in bulk, then selling it at a mark-up.

Some of the accessible schools were straight out of a scene from those World Vision commercials. This shed holds 400 students of all grades separated by black boards. While in class, you can hear the sounds of the other classes because there’s no actual walls between them. Parents can pay for school fees with Sarafu.

Below left is another school that we visited with Voluntours (see previous newsletter) that they built, where not all classrooms yet have tables. Below right is children walking to class in one of the remote village communities. All students need to wear uniforms for the school to be federally acknowledged as a school. Being a legitimate school means the government can help provide you with teachers.

Community currencies also get used locally as a means of savings. People form SILC groups (specialized investment and lending corporations), where they pool money together each week into a shared fund. If someone has a need, they can take a loan from the pool and return it back over time. Here’s a weekly meeting for one of these SILC groups.

And that’s it for the poverty porn (will that word get us sent to spam..?). Speaking of, here’s a card game we played with some of Ivy’s friends in Nairobi. It’s Cards Against Humanity but for humanitarians, called Jaded Aid.

The difference in quality of living really is stark even between neighborhoods that are literally next to each other. After our visit to the slums, we took a short 20 cent bus ride and ended back where we were staying. There you can find amazing Chinese food (Chinese penetration is growing), hip cafes, bars, malls at western prices, avocados for 30 cents, and steak for $10.

And from where we were staying, if you then took a $2 Uber ride another mile away, you’d be in the rolling hills of the Crazy Rich Kenyans. Here it’s hard to see much because everything’s behind gated communities, but occasionally you’ll catch a glimpse in the distance of some mansions.

Apparently many of the richest people in Kenya are Indians that immigrated four generations ago to work on the railroads. Their families now make the furniture in everyone’s homes and work in other such traditional industries. The other extremely wealthy people are of course the politicians...
