BEFORE:
FEEL BAD WHEN THEY FEEL BAD - INTELLECTUALLY WHAT IS IT LIKE BEING IN THEIR
SHOES. IF I DIDN'T RELATE, THEN IT WAS HARD TO EMPATHIZE

EMPATHY VS SYMPATHY

EMPATHY AT ITS CORE - EMOTIONS ARE UNIVERSAL

I've always thought that I understood people &mdash; I pick up on
others' emotions fairly easily and can channel and feel them. Recently I found
out that my perception was not at all the reality. I was told by several close
friends in different situations that they didn't feel understood by me. How
could this be?! I thought I knew fully well how people felt. Where did the communication break down?

After reading more about interpersonal communication, I came to learn that
albeit I picked up on the emotions of others, I didn't express to them that I
did. How would they have ever known that I empathized with them if I never
showed that to be the case?

That sounds like a easy problem to solve - just tell them when I understand and
feel the emotions they felt! Turns out this was harder than I'd imagined. Before
this I had rarely ever vocalized my emotions, and because of this I actually had
a very limited vocabulary for expressing my emotions. And in fact, I actually
had a very hard time identifying the feelings I felt.

##Importance of empathy

Have you been in a situation where someone nags you or gives you unsolicited
advice and you just tune them out?  Now, have you been in a situation where you
feel like you're giving someone a quality solution to their problem, but then
you feel misunderstood or ignored because they don't listen to you?

One of those scenarios is when you're on one side of the fence, and the other is
the other side. This is what happens when there isn't empathy - you're just
talking at each other. If you can empathize and fully understand their point of
view, and express to them you've understood their point of view, then they're
more receptive to coming to a solution.  This is important in both work place
problem solving, as well as personal problem solving, and even in the political 
arena.

In light of recent politics, where it seems people are becoming more and more 
polarized, I find it more and more important for people to empathize with 
others. For us to see each other as complex humans, and to try and actually 
understand where they're coming from instead of jumping to conclusions.

##How to empathy

Think of yourself in the other person's shoes. Don't just think of their point
of view, and then refute it. Think about the emotions you'd feel if you were in
their point of view, given their background. How does that feel? If it doesn't
make sense to you, then you're not actually empathizing. Go off the assumption
that they're logical, just with different logic than your own.
