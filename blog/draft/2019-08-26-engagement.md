_Welcome to the Newsletter Series. [Ivy](http://ivyxu.co/?utm_source=referral&&utm_medium=owenwangdotcom){:target="_blank"} and I co-write a [periodic newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/03e9ab1adc54/ivyowen){:target="_blank"}. This piece is adapted from an edition of it, dated when the newsletter came out._
<br/>
<br/>

__Early May__

Owen orders the ring to his friend Tommy‚Äôs place and starts discussing a plan with Ivy‚Äôs best friends Yifan and Yiti (henceforth Y&Y) for how a proposal would go down. From previous discussions, Owen knew that Ivy's ideal proposal would be private, have a scenic view, her friends would be there, and it'd be a surprise. They were already planning a girls‚Äô trip sans Owen, so that would be an opportune occasion for meeting the requirements.

__May 21__

The ring arrives at Tommy‚Äôs place. He excitedly goes to share the news with some friends, but accidentally began to do so in the wrong chat...one with Ivy in it! With quick improvisation he avoided a disaster.

__Late June__

Ivy discovers the group messenger chat between Owen and her best friends, with code names "Joe Wang" and "Joe Zhou" ‚Äî very indiscreet. Owen had been careful to delete the messages for the most part, but it turns out he forgot a few, which left a bit of incriminating evidence. The only thing Ivy could decipher was that Y&Y offered to leave Croatia earlier so that Ivy could spend time in Croatia with Owen alone.

Frantically brainstorming with his friends, Owen came up with a plausible alibi. He'd never been to Croatia so he wanted to travel there as well and surprise Ivy in the process. He abandoned that plan because his friend Jamie was now visiting him! Ivy seemed to believe this and was thrown off the tracks. She told Owen that she didn't want him to crash her girls trip (he was forgiven for doing so after the proposal). Owen then proceeded to create a Yahoo email for all future communications, something Ivy would be unlikely to ever discover.

Y&Y told Ivy that they have matching white lace dresses that they will wear in Croatia. Ivy decides to get one made while in Vietnam to match them.

__July 31__

Ivy got her phone stolen (see the last newsletter), so she would now share Owen‚Äôs phone for the remaining weeks leading up to the proposal. This meant sharing the same apps and switching between accounts on IG, WeChat, and often messaging her friends on Owen's Messenger. This made Owen extra nervous about communications and notifications coming in as Ivy was always on his phone. He deleted apps that had any traces (Airbnb, Yahoo Mail) and became very careful with logging out and using incognito mode. Finally, the use case Google thinks people use incognito for ‚Äî [planning surprises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu5b_jYWVcQ). üôÑ

__August 16__

Owen leaves Singapore for Vienna, Austria in the morning. 

Ivy is stuck by herself with no phone (stolen), a half working laptop (broken keyboard), no debit card or drivers license (expired). She flies to Dubrovnik, Croatia later that night.

Yiti messages Ivy that she got her nails done for the vacation and pressures Ivy to get her nails done too. Ivy just had a finger infection and refused.

__10pm__

Owen meets up with Jamie in Vienna! He explains the plan he‚Äôs come up with for the coming few days to Jamie: 

Ivy always wants to stop by fruit tea stalls when she sees them, so we will set one up along their drive up the coast. The girls will stop by it and it'll be unmanned, so they‚Äôll read the menu while they wait. The menu will contain drinks based on our story, with each item getting progressively more suspect. While they‚Äôre reading, Owen will come out of hiding to propose. 

Logistics-wise, we either ask someone to borrow their stall or we try and build one ourselves. The location, the time, how we‚Äôll communicate with the girls, the speech Owen will give, the menu items, and how the interaction will go down are all TBD. Jamie‚Äôs response: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not a plan‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs just an idea!‚Äù

__August 17__

Ivy hangs out by herself in Dubrovnik, binge watching TV.

Owen and Jamie (henceforth O&J) explore the tourist town of Hallstatt, making sure to send Ivy some photos to prove they‚Äôre really in Austria. They decide commandeering someone else‚Äôs stall would be hard because of language barrier and the logistics around borrowing it while still keeping the occasion private. Building one would also be challenging since the car wouldn't be able to fit something so large in it and disposal would be problematic. They scrap the fruit tea stall idea and start brainstorming alternatives that would still be personal, memorable, yet somewhat derpy (that‚Äôs Owen‚Äôs style).

__August 18__

O&J on their speed tour of Austria go to Salzburg. Turns out just about everything is closed on Sundays (amazing work life balance) so they can‚Äôt run the errands they had planned to and have trouble even finding fast food to eat. The beer garden is still open and is where everyone seems to be. Good beers were had, then they hopped on an overnight bus to Split, Croatia.

Y&Y show up in Dubrovnik, #familybffretreat begins! At dinner, Ivy goes off about how she wishes Owen would propose already and complained about how she would have to wait until next year once they settle down. She predicts the timing of the proposal based on the time Owen must work to buy the ring. Also, being with Owen 24/7 and sharing a phone, there's no way a surprise could be planned right now.

Y&Y discuss whether Ivy has caught on to the plan and is playing dumb or if she actually has no idea (it's the latter). Either way, they decide to go along with it since Ivy seemed okay with getting engaged.

__August 19__

__7am__

O&J groggily arrive in Split. They pick up their rental car and drive the coast to scout out potential locations for the proposal.

__1pm__

O&J find a nice spot where you park along the coast, walk down a short trail, then you have an open view of the ocean. There‚Äôs even an abandoned metal structure there that could be transformed into a fruit tea stall. What a crazy random happenstance! The original plan is back on!

__3pm__

Ivy and Y&Y explore Dubrovnik and take a million photos on the old town walls. She writes captions around how this trip will have no randos (the boyfriends).

__5pm__

O&J explore the very local neighborhoods of Split, from stationery stores to hardware stores. People try to talk to them exclusively in Croatian.
Jamie used a branch to estimate the dimensions of the metal structure and brought it to the stores to measure supplies.

__10pm__

While Ivy is in the shower, Yiti tells Yifan to act like she really wants to do her nails so that Ivy would want to do her nails too. After Ivy's shower, Yiti aggressively paints Ivy's nails, pulls out her blackheads, and gives her a facemask.

Ivy pays no attention and ruins her nails when she packs. Yiti immediately fixes them.

Yiti's Beauty Salon

__12am__

Ivy tries to FaceTime Owen but he refuses to pick up, saying he‚Äôs too tired. In reality he‚Äôs surrounded by arts and crafts and he‚Äôs not sure if he could keep his alibi straight about where he‚Äôs at / what he did today if they actually talked.

__1:30am__

O&J finish construction! There‚Äôs various signs to lead the girls to the stall, a banner for the stall‚Äôs name, a sign for the table saying we‚Äôll be right back (the clock hands are where we camped at Burning Man last year), and the drink menu (click for higher quality image).

__August 20__

__8am__

It's game day! O&J head back to the location to set up. Their makeshift table surface idea doesn‚Äôt go as planned, but zipties save the day with making everything magically work.

<img src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/e9a2a7ba7716f6b270bbe04e5/images/8a516fc4-83ee-4cd5-af2d-3a7ac394d5d8.jpg" />

__11am__

The girls start driving from Dubrovnik to Split. Ivy sees that both Y&Y keep texting in a Whatsapp group named "Hello", she questions who that's with and Yiti responds with Chris, a friend in Toronto. 

Y&Y keep saying how much they want fruit tea and how Yiti would love to support local businesses.

__2pm__

O&J finish setting up and see the girls are close from their shared real time location tracking. They hide behind a rock and Owen is freaked out. 2 minutes before they arrive, he exclaims ‚ÄúOh crap what am I supposed to do with my hands during the speech!?‚Äù

__THE PROPOSAL__

Y&Y go down the path. Ivy is hesitant and doesn't think the view is there and decides the fruit tea stand looks a bit like a shed (compared to real fruit stands on the road).

Ivy goes down the path only so that she's not left behind. Y&Y then go to the shade and tell Ivy to read the menu and tell them what to order.

Thinking that they just wanted to stand in the shade and make her stand in the sun, she skims through the first 2 things on the menu and moves towards the shade too. The first item on the menu has mangos, her favorite, so there was no need to read further.

<img src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/e9a2a7ba7716f6b270bbe04e5/images/263afd2b-862f-4c72-9162-58c805e88ec2.gif" />
Yiti sneakily video taping

Ivy didn't notice the cameras rolling. Seeing that there was real fruit on the "table", she thought maybe the owners of the stand were off getting more water or fruit.

<img src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/e9a2a7ba7716f6b270bbe04e5/images/c5fe0279-67dc-4a88-94d9-d1bb50e67ea4.gif" />
Just as Ivy was walking away Owen comes out with flowers. She looks back at her friends thinking "are you surprised too?"

The rest of the proposal is a blackout for both of us. But rewatching the footage, Ivy interrupted Owen many times during his speech. 

<img src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/e9a2a7ba7716f6b270bbe04e5/images/42d0ce4b-75ed-44db-a92a-a6344f8759b9.jpg" />

The first was to throw away the sunglasses in her hand since Owen was holding that instead of her hands.

The second time was to tell Owen to "go on" as he was nervously frozen in place.

The third time was when he still didn't continue after "go on", Ivy laughed and said "this is the worst".

The fourth time was Ivy deciding to take off her hat since it blocked her full view of Owen.

FINALLY. The ring comes out and Ivy's first reaction was leaning down to inspect the ring and deciding "it's the one I wanted!"

Then whispering an inaudible "Yes". All in all, very graceful and unfiltered.

<img src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/e9a2a7ba7716f6b270bbe04e5/images/297a7413-3eb9-4f56-ad26-482ecc49e3d5.png" />

Tears only came out after Ivy calmed down from her shock and read the menu fully.

She loved the reminiscing and understood the amount of thought and effort it took to actually surprise a control freak like her.

Following, we took some photos with the actual view instead of the bush we ended up under, and with the friends who helped make it all happen!

The rest of the trip we spent enjoying the company of our friends, visiting Krka and Hvar, and learning that Yiti is brutal & scary.

On the flight out of Croatia to Athens, since Owen secretly booked the same ticket separately, we sat apart. It only really hit Ivy that she was engaged when the person next to her spotted her ring and asked her "Where is your husband?"

We're both extremely grateful for our friends taking so much time out of their lives to help make this occasion special for us, and we're definitely suffering from some friendship withdrawal now.
