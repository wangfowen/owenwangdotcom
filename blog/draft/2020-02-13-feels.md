_Welcome to the Newsletter Series. [Ivy](http://ivyxu.co/?utm_source=referral&&utm_medium=owenwangdotcom){:target="_blank"} and I co-write a [periodic newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/03e9ab1adc54/ivyowen){:target="_blank"}. This piece is adapted from an edition of it._
<br/>
<br/>

Over the last month we’ve just been at home working, but a lot of feels went down. We’ll be splitting this newsletter and giving our updates separately, kind of like [Ivy’s month visiting factories](https://mailchi.mp/c85341631a6b/the-past-month-ivy-edition) and [Owen’s month working in a kitchen](/blog/kitchen) back when we were in HK and Shenzhen. If you liked hearing about [our reflections and growth in our relationship](/blog/vanalysis), you’ll get a taste of that as well.
 
# Month of January with Ivy

January was a really big month for me. Here are some milestones that I hit:

1. Launched my Non-Technically Speaking Podcast! We are already 6 episodes in! I interview non-tech leaders in tech, do solo shows on what I’ve learned about setting myself and my career up for success, and talk about all things an “ambitious, impact-hungry, non-technical professional in tech who wants to do more with his/her career” (yes that is my target market) cares about - so personal branding, entrepreneurship, intrapreneurship, and emerging markets with emerging tech. 
2. 5k month of income in my career coaching business! What? Since when? I’ll get to that later.
3. Switched from 1:1 coaching to group coaching AND hit the same sales conversion rates with selling my program with a group webinar vs. 30min 1:1 strategy/sales calls.

Okay what career coaching business? 

When we were back in North Carolina in November, Owen was still working 2 jobs and I worked maybe 4 hours/week doing e-commerce consulting. This off-balance in free time and income drove me kind of crazy (strong independent woman vibes). I didn’t want to take on more e-commerce consulting clients, it was trading time for money, even if it was $150/hour. The whole year I wanted to see if I could build something of my own, some kind of passive income, so that’s what I initially set out to do. 

Ever since my [post in 2016](https://www.ivyxu.co/resources/2016-06-06-job-hunting-san-francisco/) about job hunting in San Francisco went viral, I still receive LinkedIn messages around this article every week (great SEO I know). I also love writing about career and afterall, our whole journey was a career discovery journey in 2019. What if I could somehow monetize this traffic? Seemed to also go well with the podcast I wanted to create too. I can use the podcast as lead generation, I thought.

So over Thanksgiving, I invested in an online group coaching program for new coaches. The program is supposed to get coaches to their first paid client.

In the first module, we are supposed to send out market research surveys and hop on calls with at least 3-5 potential clients to understand their needs so that we can craft an offer and coaching program in the later modules. I decided to include a chance to win one of 3 free coaching calls with me as an incentive to fill out my survey.

Within 3 days I had 90+ responses. 90+ non-technical professionals wanted help getting a job at a tech company. Through the market research survey, I saw the same problems coming up again and again. Feeling like lack of opportunities, not feeling validated, not hearing back from applications, not having a network, not enough experience in tech, not enough tech skills - all things I had personally experienced.

So I gave 50 free coaching calls instead of 3. I finished the 9 week course in 1 week because I just didn’t know what to do with so much demand. I converted my first client on my 4th call, the second one on my 6th call. I mastered this sales process and in 24 calls I did in December, I closed 8 1:1 clients who bought between 2-5 sessions with me. On average I made about $360/client.

By the time January rolled around, 8 1:1 clients took up 8 hours/week, plus I had 26 more 30min coaching calls I lined up 2-3 nights a week for 4 hours at a time. I was dying and started to resent sounding like a broken record teaching the same lessons on coaching and strategy calls. 

I saw potential in growing this business, but I never wanted to be JUST a career coach. After some days of 8 hours on calls and losing my voice, I knew something had to change. So 3 weeks ago, after validating that students resonated with my coaching lesson plans with 1:1 coaching, I decided to switch everyone into a group coaching program where lessons are taught via video and the whole group gets 4 weekly group coaching calls. I also decided to automate away the 30 min strategy call as part of the sales process into one group webinar.

On my first try, 72 people responded to my application for the chance to get one of 3 free coaching calls, 16 people attended my group webinar, and 7 people signed up for my group course. 2 from the previous strategy calls and 2 1:1 clients also paid for the course. So now with 11 students, instead of 11 hours of 1:1s, I do 1 hour of group coaching.

A gif for anyone that paid me

To get to this point took a lot of work for both me and Owen, who generously helped me build customized tools.

I had to create and film lessons, build a webinar with enough information to be as catchy as a personalized coaching call, and figure out lead generation. Owen had to help build a course hosting platform (software out there costs $120/month). We did all this in the span of 2 weeks. I’m pretty proud of us.

I didn’t expect so much success as a career coach and from the time 90+ people responded in need of coaching it just kind of snowballed. I felt an obligation to see things through. Building out the podcast and a coaching business involved building out my personal brand and thinking about how I wanted to be known by the world. This led to a lot of introspection and realization of how much my own personal identity matters to me.

# Month of January with Owen

January marks the start of fully diving into building our own company! I went from working two part time jobs the last part of 2019 to one in December, then cut my hours from 25 to 16 a week starting January. This gave me 3-4 days a week to work on our ideas.

Before we left for the holidays, we saw some promise in the food retail space. As we dug deeper, it looked less and less like what we wanted to do. We spent several sessions brainstorming new ideas, yet they didn’t get us anywhere concrete. We finished each session with many more questions, realizing we knew very little about the actual problems in our areas of interest.

This period had me often feeling anxious and purposeless in a way I hadn’t felt before. Where were we headed? There were so many unknowns ahead of us. What was I to do with all the time I had set aside? Ivy was cold calling people and conducting market research to answer some of our questions, but I hated getting on the phone with people — a friend once gave me a great restaurant recommendation but said I needed to call to make a reservation... I never went.

As I talked to founder friends and read articles online, I saw that uncertainty goes hand in hand with every step of running a startup, and so is doing things you’re not good at. I was briefly motivated to overcome my weaknesses and did some cold email reach outs (baby steps). But anxiety continued to swirl despite my recognition that uncertainty is normal. I just wanted to build something. There were several moments where I thought about returning to a steady paying job with a roadmap laid out for me. Then I’d think about how this is what stops many others from becoming their own boss and it drives me to continue down our route.

Since Ivy was also starting her coaching side business, I figured I’d help build her some tools with my extra time. Turns out there's a reason companies have whole teams dedicated to video processing... Partly I was satiating that desire to build, partly I was procrastinating from facing more uncertainty. Through this process, we saw pain points other coaches were experiencing, and we’d been reading about the rise of the passion economy (which online coaching falls under), so this turned into a new lead for our company!

I began prototyping some of the ideas we had, but now felt another kind of uncertainty: is this the right idea to work on, one that we’d both be passionate about, would do good for the world, and would make us money? We had left so many other ideas on the table unexplored. Would this really be the best use of our time? Are we thinking too narrow? Could this be a problem space we’d want to work on for the next decade?

From talking about it with Ivy, and seeing how some of our other friends had been market researching for over a year, I recognized this process could be potentially endless. If we have a promising starting point, we should just start on it. Who knows where it can lead and how it’d evolve. Taking it one actionable step at a time is better than sitting around just theorizing.

# Coming Together

As Owen worked on prototypes, we realized we needed to talk with more potential customers to understand the core of the problems we were solving for. Ivy was tasked with this, but she was swamped with her coaching. Owen began to feel resentful that Ivy wasn’t putting in her share of time for our business, that her side income stream was now her main priority.

This culminated in a heartfelt and cathartic conversation where Owen expressed his frustrations and we cried. A lot. We both acknowledged that we’d felt ourselves becoming more disconnected from each other. Ivy was feeling stressed about meeting client expectations, but also stressed and guilty about not spending enough time working on our business. Owen understood this, but he couldn’t understand why her coaching was so high on her priorities when we were intending to dedicate this year into something that’s ours.

As Ivy explained her recent reflections on her identity, it became clear. Ivy needed to find her own personal identity first before we could embark on something together. The coaching wasn’t just about side income, but about who she was as an individual, what she was able to accomplish on her own.

Owen also decided that just because we’re co-founders doesn’t mean we always have to be working the exact same hours. He had depended on her for initial market research and therefore direction of our (non-existent) company. Ivy didn’t have the headspace for strategy because she was trying to automate her coaching business, so that she would have headspace again. 

In conclusion, we agreed that Owen can flex his leadership skills by taking lead on the direction of what to explore next and Ivy,  feeling supported and personally fulfilled after a successful month of personal brand building, is now ready to commit her attention back to building out a business together.

This has been a whirlwind of a month. Now begins our startup journey for reals.
