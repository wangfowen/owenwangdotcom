I've been told that when I post on the internet, I should keep my work life and personal life separate. I've already done a terrible job with that; my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wangfowen) is cluttered with personal tweets, and my Facebook sporadically sees posts about tech.

I figure if I'm going to blog, I should write about what I feel like. Therefore there won't be any theme to what you see here. I'm going to blog about everything from tech to my life to random other things. I'm primarily doing this for personal purposes - improve at writing and document things that I don't want to forget. You could consider it a personal memo really.

Now, since you're reading this, Dear Reader, cheers to you. I don't know what you may gain from my ramblings, but I hope you derive some sort of amusement or useful information from it.
