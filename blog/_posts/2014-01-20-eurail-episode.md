A soft tap on my shoulder awakens me from my nap. I groggily rise from the fetal 
position I had assumed in the corner of the overcrowded train. Overlooking me is 
a daunting bearded fellow wearing a black brimmed cap and navy blue uniform. The 
Sherlock in me concludes he must be the ticket collector. Standing at 6'6" at 
least, probably German descent.

I dig through my bag for my Eurail pass, a bit nervous as this is my first time 
using it. When I give him the evidently unopened booklet, the towering man flips 
through it, eyebrows scrunched. He meets my gaze and states with a hint of 
sarcasm, "Your pass is not validated. You need to do that _before_ getting on 
the train."

He hands me back my pass and points at the bolded line labeled step 1. Oops. 
I've never been good at following directions.

"It's okay this time, but make sure you validate it at the station before your 
next trip."

Now reading the instructions for the first time, I scribble in all my personal 
information. A blank for end date confuses me. The pass lasts for 2 months so do 
I put 2 months from now or the last known date I'll be traveling? I'll be gone 
for sure by the end of January, so I figure I'll be safe if I put that.

When the train arrives at my stop, I immediately head to the ticket office, 
conveniently located near the entrance of the station. The line in front of me 
gradually dissipates and I approach the glass pane. I want to get this sorted 
fast, eager to explore the new city. The lady behind the counter looks to be in 
her 40s, a redhead with an expressionless demeanor.

"Hi, I didn't know I had to validate before I used my pass. Can I get it 
validated now?"

She judgingly shakes her head as she reviews the papers.

"You don't write end date. I do that." She states through a thick accent.  
"Oh, sorry. The instructions didn't mention this. Is it a problem?"  
"This end date is no good. This is not two months."  
"Yeah it's less than two months. I won't be traveling past that date."  
"This is no good. I can't validate."  
"Uhh can you just write the correct date over it then?"  
"No!" She responds incredulous, followed by something in German that I didn't 
understand. My vocabulary is unfortunately limited to "sorry" (the first word 
every Canadian should learn in new languages), "thanks", and "watermelon".  
"...can you white it out?"  
Again, the same response.  
"Can I get a new pass with one used on it?"  
"No, this is a promotional pass."  
"Is there anything I can do?" Irked at this point as she keeps denying my 
suggestions without offering a solution.  
"When you go on train, maybe conductor will accept pass. I can't validate."  
"What!?" I've lost my patience. "What if I just write over it myself. I don't 
see what the problem is."  
Her answer is more fast-spoken German, which I take to mean no from her body 
language.  
"So you're saying all I can do is _hope_ they let me ride the train.  Every 
single time from now on."  
"Yes."

I bitterly thank her and storm off indignant. As I exit, I step to the side and 
write over the end date with the right one, using my lap as a makeshift table. I 
bet if I go again tomorrow, whoever is working then will validate it. That'll 
show her.

The following morning I return bright and early. This time I'm greeted by a 
fuller lady with dark brown hair. Like the other woman she betrays no emotions 
in her face.

I smugly request, "Hi, I'd like to validate my pass."  
She glances at it and tersely declares, "The end date is written over. No one 
will validate this."

I take a moment to let her words settle, stunned speechless, then leave with 
resignation.  Hard to argue with that one.

The rest of the morning I keep thinking back to what happened and counting how 
many more trains I still have to take. Determined to not let this ruin my 
holiday, I remind myself that the worst case scenario is I just have to pay more 
each trip, and push it out of my mind.

My mood picks up through the day. Walking along a lake with mountains in the 
backdrop is surprisingly uplifting. There's a serene silence, the only sound 
being the rhythmic crash of waves. At sunset the colorful sky blends with the 
shades of the rocks and water, meshing to make one spectacular rainbow.

When I make my way back to my hostel that night, I stop by the train station 
again. With a better state of mind and the worst case scenario narrowed to a 
manageable situation, I decide there's no harm in trying again.

This time a guy in his late 20's manned the station, a contagious smile across 
his face.

"Hi! I screwed up and wrote in the end date myself. Can I still get this 
validated?"

He looks at it and cheerfully tells me it's not a problem since the start date 
is unchanged. I just have to make sure I don't write in the wrong usage days.
I beam as he stamps his approval and let out a sigh of relief.

I'm sure there's a moral here about having a positive attitude, perseverance, or 
paying better attention, but I think the real lesson here is that good customer 
service reps are unsung heroes. People all have horror stories about customer 
service, yet the ones that are greatly helpful are often taken for granted. The 
power that man granted with a single stamp saved me from days of headache.
