Greetings and welcome to _cheff’s table_ – a dining experience that educates through food. This seating, we’ll be exploring climate change. 

Let’s start by taking a look at the candle in front of you. It offers a few hints about what we need to transition our planet to a stable climate.

<img src="/blog/images/climatarian/candle.png" />

This candle is a source of warmth. We’ve transitioned from open fire to coal and now to natural gas for heating. This has reduced our emissions but we need to get off burning fossil fuels altogether. Heat pumps have paved the way by being a superior product that’s all electric, we just need to increase the rate of adoption.

This candle is a source of light. We’ve done pretty well on increasing our energy efficiency by moving from candles to incandescent light to LEDs. As developing countries mature, we expect their energy usage to increase, so with the pie growing, not only do we need our energy to go green, we also need to dramatically increase our efficiency everywhere we use it.

More surprising perhaps, this candle is also a source of sustenance. You see, this candle is made from browned butter with rosemary and garlic infused. To reach a stable climate, we need to transform our entire system of food. For now, start by transforming this candle into a dip for your bread.

Over the course of this meal, we hope to give you culinary symbols to remember two key facets of the transformation we need – decreasing the footprint of what we eat, and decreasing the footprint of what we don’t eat.

It turns out that those are some of the most impactful ways that we can combat climate change! The following is a table of solutions from Project Drawdown, a non-profit dedicated to finding the highest leverage climate solutions, sorted by highest impact. Peek the top two.

They might not seem like much from an individual perspective, but collectively our efforts add up to massive impact.

# What We Eat

How do we decrease the footprint of what we eat? The spoiler from Project Drawdown is that we eat plant-rich diets. But what does that mean and how do we go about doing it in a way that doesn’t feel like a huge sacrifice?

We’ll start to see with our upcoming dishes!

## ton for ton

Our next course is the salad course. Here we have a large bowl of pomegranate and padron pepper salad with a mushroom garum dressing, avocados, and sliced almonds. Beside it we have a medium bowl of pan seared chicken and a tiny bowl of dry brined steak.

This amount of salad has the same carbon footprint as the chicken and steak beside it. The salad is only that size because of the avocados, which have larger footprints due to the deforestation and water consumption to grow them. Without them, the salad’s portion would be too much for the meal.

Shifting to a plant-rich diet doesn’t necessarily mean going vegetarian or vegan. It doesn’t have to be all or nothing. Visually, we can see that just by reducing our red meat intake, we’d be making a big difference.

If eating entirely plant-based is hard for you, perhaps if you’re at a restaurant torn between the chicken and beef options, choose the chicken. Alternatively, opt to eat plant-based once or twice a week, or try to fill more of your plate with veggies. The fiber in veggies is healthy in other ways, but that’s a separate story.

## seitanic saucery

A common concern with eating more plant-rich is that it’s hard to get sufficient protein, or that you’d just be eating all tofu all the time. But tofu isn’t the only meat-alternative protein option. Seitan or gluten rolls, derived from wheat protein rather than soy, can be upwards of 80% protein by calories.

Here we have shallow fried gluten puffs with roasted peanuts, bell peppers, and mangos in a kung pao inspired glaze, garnished with sesame and nutritional yeast.

Although you’re unlikely to eat your weight in nutritional yeast, it’s a great topping for an additional source of protein. Nutritional yeast is 70% protein by calories and can [intensely boost](https://youtu.be/GHX3aaLmjMI){:target="_blank"} the deliciousness of your food! Other great sources are lupini beans (55%), tempeh (45%), and certain seaweeds (up to 45%).

## but where are you REALLY from?

This next course is shakshuka baked in a puff pastry tart. Each guest gets two tarts – one uses San Marzano tomatoes from Italy and the other tomatoes from nearby Los Gatos in Northern California.

Without knowing which is which, try both and decide which you like best. 

Eating local gets a lot of attention, and while it’s true that the farther that a food goes, the more emissions are involved, the climate impact from transportation is generally a tiny fraction of the bigger picture. And most of that impact is from last mile delivery.

<img src="/blog/images/climatarian/emissions.png" />

From this graph, can you even pick out the amount from transport? What should be clear from the graph is that per the courses before, what you eat matters more than where it came from.

One nuance in this topic is that emissions calculations are very complicated and we do not yet have good tools in place to do them systemically. Most of the data we have are averages across a couple farm’s lifecycles. The carbon footprint of one farm could be drastically different from that of another, even in the same region. For example, a tomato grown in a greenhouse is 9x worse than one grown in an open field. For now, all we can do is be hand wavy and generalize about categories of food.

# What We Don't Eat

So far everything we’ve been focused on is the footprint of what we eat. Now it’s time to consider the footprint of what we don’t eat. How much of America’s food do you think goes to waste?

The answer is 30-40%, and of that amount, over 40% of it is wasted in our own homes! Another 40% is wasted in grocery stores and restaurants. Farms and manufacturers contribute to the small remainder.

When food is thrown out, it sits in landfills and releases methane as it rots, a super potent greenhouse gas that has 80x the warming power of carbon dioxide.

## grateful dead

Armed with a few techniques, you can find ways to use ingredients when they’re past their prime and avoid the landfill. For example, if you purée old spinach, it will still serve beautifully as part of a salad dressing. To avoid wasting the peels of citrus, you can grate them to add zest.

Here we have assorted roasted veg with a greek goddess dressing made with old spinach and herb with grated lemon zest.

Some other ways you can find new life for ingredients:
- Leftover rice can be made into fried rice. In fact, that’s actually encouraged as the way to make fried rice since the moisture content is lower
- Aside from puree, veggies can be blanched, pickled, or fermented to extend their life
- Stale bread can be made into croutons, great as a topping for eating more plant-rich salads!
- Brown bananas can be made into tasty banana bread
- For the more advanced cooks, veggie and meat scraps can be used to make stock. Great as the basis for many sauces, stews, and more

## lost: bread

And for our final course, we have… milk?

<img src="/blog/images/climatarian/carton.png" />

Do you throw out your milk as soon as it’s past the expiration date? It turns out, food doesn’t go bad the minute it crosses the “best before”. Those dates are usually set by manufacturers based on “optimal” consumption, not food safety. Eggs, for example, are usually still edible 3-5 weeks after the date on the carton. 

When you want to evaluate safety, use your senses, not the label. If it doesn’t smell funky, you don’t see mold, and you’ve cooked it to a proper temperature, your food should generally be safe. Yet another reason to eat more plant-rich is that it’s much harder to mess up food safety when it comes to plants!

The question remains though, what do you do with milk and eggs past their prime? In French, the name for French toast is “pain perdu”, or literally “lost bread”. It’s a great way to combine the old bread forgotten at the bottom of the drawer, the milk you’re worried about drinking cold, and eggs you don’t want to eat raw anymore (if you ever did that to begin with). 

So for our real final course, we have as dessert a croissant French toast with crème fraiche, fruits, and powdered sugar.
