Be open
Exude positive energy, don't make your problems other people's problems
Spend time together
Communication is very key
The image from Psychology Textbook
Compromises are important. We can't always get our way. Some things we have to make compromises on. But also we have to know / take a stand on what are non-compromisable.
Let go of the little things
Appreciate the little things. Laugh a little
