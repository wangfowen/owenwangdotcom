Taking lessons from the Lean Startup, we've been traveling as agile as possible. We start with our minimum viable plan (MVP) - the locations we want to check out - start at one of them, then decide plans for what to do at those places, and where we want to go afterwards as we go along. Only when we're at one location do we really think about where we want to go next. We find out what we enjoy and don't enjoy from each place and iterate. This is great because we can pivot at any point when we hear about some other place we hadn't previously considered. Or if we particularly enjoy a city, we can stay longer. Conversely, if we hate a city, we leave ASAP. We don't get tied down by tickets we've purchased in advance. We don't feel rushed to do things. We can live slowly (link) when we choose to, or cram as much in a day as possible when we have the energy. For instance, we ran some tests on whether guided tours were for us. Those tests disastrously failed and we won't be taking any more of those in the future. (graph of number of people vs fun)
Real life tour is like looking at the place on the internet, except slower-paced and much more crowded. How I'd enjoy the Sistine chapel is laying down in complete silence observing it in awe. Instead we were cramped in the room and someone on the loudspeaker boomed every couple minutes "Silencio", totally ruining the vibe.

We are still iterating as we go along, trying to figure out how best to engage new people in hostels? Best way to ask around about good, cheap local restaurants? Non touristy things to do?

Of course this does have its shortcomings. By not doing research in advance you 
may encounter problems with tickets being sold out. We just deal with the 
problems as they come along, no point in stressing too much about them 
beforehand. Even if you plan for everything, there are still unexpected problems 
that may occur. We usually leave ample time in between what we want to do and 
ask around about what we should watch out for, and so far we haven't had too 
many major issues, nothing that couldn't be dealt with. We've been very lucky 
with people giving us the information we've needed.  Another shortcoming of this 
is sometimes things take more time/money than it would had we planned ahead of 
time. This ties back to overpaid syndrome - we consider the freedom a worthy 
tradeoff.
