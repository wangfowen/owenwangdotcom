Positivity around me is infectious. Need more of it. I should contribute more to 
positivity.

A major thing I need to improve on in leadership is blame. Instead of getting 
mad, assigning blame, and being negative, I should think more about how to 
prevent those problems from occurring in the future.

blame and anger are not at all productive
i do it because it helps me feel better about myself, but what does it actually do to further whatever it is weâ€™re trying to do?
Same with guilt. Especially recently a lot of guilt about all the issues in the 
world. Family members scraping pennies when I'm waste fully spending. How can I 
dare to be happy derping instead of spending that time using my privileges to 
give back? Can't give back until you yourself are in a good happy place.
