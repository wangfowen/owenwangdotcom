As I said in my [previous post](/blog/20-14-hindsight), I spent a lot of time 
reflecting about improving relationships this past year. It started with this 
Twitter conversation I eavesdropped upon between my friend Jonathan and someone 
named Nav:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/wikichen">@wikichen</a> Dude, how do you make CLOSE friends with people? Beyond the small-talk and how is your weekend crap? Been bothering me for time.</p>&mdash; Nav Dhillon (@Navjotd) <a href="https://twitter.com/Navjotd/status/445673386547503104">March 17, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

In response I essentially advised that if you open yourself up to others close 
friendships will naturally form. Ironically, I later met Nav in real life, and I 
did not follow my own advice.

In thinking more about why that happened, I've decided becoming friends is not 
as simple as the one step of just opening up... it's actually 3 steps! Nav and I 
had failed at an earlier step and that's why we're not currently best friends 
forever. I'm sure in reality there's much more involved, but then this post 
wouldn't be able to go viral on BuzzFeed, would it?

Before I get into these steps that will change your life, you might ask what 
does it even mean to have close friends?

In my childhood, I had some friends whom I hung out with due to the convenience 
of proximity. We'd talk about schoolwork or play games together, and that was 
the extent of our friendship. With those friends, if I ever had an issue 
unrelated to gaming or school, I'd feel uncomfortable asking them for advice.

With my current friends, I can talk to them about anything and everything, even 
things like sex, or finance. I'd say that's the difference that closeness 
brings.  A close friend you can trust with personal matters. You can turn to 
them for help without feeling discomfort, and they'd be there for you. 
Meaningful friendships not only [ameliorate bad 
situations](http://www.centreforconfidence.co.uk/flourishing-lives.php?p=cGlkPTIwMSZpZD03ODg=){:target="_blank"}, 
they also [make good situations even 
better](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/without-friends-or-family-even-extraordinary-experiences-are-disappointing/){:target="_blank"}.

If you already have a close social group, you may think this guide won't be of 
any use to you, but maybe this can help you get even closer! At the same time, 
it's still good to make new friends. If we hang out solely with one group of 
people, over time groupthink develops and thought patterns converge. This is 
good in reducing social friction, but it means we become stagnant. New friends 
can provide different perspectives, challenge our beliefs, and lead us to 
discover new interests.

Developing and deepening friendships is a life long process and we can always 
get better at it. So without further ado, here's my guide to friendshipping. If 
you're in a situation to make a new friend, start at step 1. If you want to get 
closer to an old friend, you may be at step 2 or 3.

##1. Get in the right mindset to converse##

Some days you might not like yourself. Some days you can't deal with other 
people. That's all okay, it happens to the best of us. But on those days it's 
probably not ideal for you to be making friends. Ideal conditions are when 
you're feeling positive and talkative.

Generally, people like positive energy. It's infectious and it makes them feel 
better. Friends may put up with negativity, but why would someone you just met 
want to deal with that if they don't have to? Maybe you can make it work 
regardless, but I find that when I'm feeling positive, it's even easier on 
myself to try to meet people.

To be more positive, try smiling and laughing more. Also, the next time you have 
a complaint or you want to reject someone's opinion, what if you just didn't say 
anything? Or what if you phrase it in a way that's more constructive?

If positivity is not your thing, at the bare minimum it's necessary to get in a 
mood to talk. A core component in meeting someone is the conversation you share. 
That conversation could potentially lead into a friendship, so be mindful to 
actively partake.

How to get into the mood to talk may vary from person to person. Some people 
prefer bigger groups, while others prefer one on one interactions. __Create an 
environment in which you'll thrive the best__. If you prefer one on one 
interactions and you meet someone in a group setting, try pulling them aside at 
some point, or invite them to something at a later time that doesn't involve as 
many people.

This step is where Nav and I went wrong. We met at a networking event where I 
had already been drained from all the socializing, so when we spoke, I was not 
in the proper state and it was hard for us to hit it off.

If you find you're often not in this mindset, don't use it as an excuse to avoid 
meeting new people. Try to get yourself in the mindset. It can take practice. I 
personally find if I eat and sleep better, I'm more sociable.

##2. Find conversation worth caring about##

Surprisingly, not everyone shares the exact same interests as me. Conversation 
doesn't work out when one person talks about something of interest to them, but 
the other person doesn't care. When one or both sides don't care, that's where 
the "small talk and how is your weekend" occurs.

One way to solve this is to find common interests we can both talk about and 
care about. __Ask open ended questions to discover more about the person__. 
Every new piece of information could potentially be a branch for another 
discussion.  But try not to rapid-fire too many questions. Then it might seem 
like an interrogation.

If we can't find common ground, another way is to __try to take an interest in 
their interests__. If I don't know anything about the subject, it's a good 
chance to learn something new about it! Making an effort to listen and genuinely 
care goes a long way.

If you can't find a common interest, and even when you try to probe and learn 
more about theirs you find it's not working out, then maybe it just doesn't work 
out. Sometimes you can't seem to find that mutual attraction no matter what. 
Maybe that means the other party didn't achieve step 1, or they're just not 
interested in you. That happens. It sucks, but don't let it stop you from trying 
to connect with other people! __Remember, both sides have to care. As long as 
you try your hardest to hold up your end, that's the most that you can do__.

##3. Open up##

As I originally hypothesized, I still think this is the most important step. But 
you can only get to here once you've done the other two and you've already 
established a friendship. That may take some time and might not happen in your 
first interactions. If you open up to someone you just met, they may use what 
they learn against you, or they might just think you're crazy.

__Common interests fuel conversation, which is what creates friendships, but 
trust is what creates meaningful friendships__. Building trust involves sharing 
things about yourself beyond just your interests - your feelings, personal 
matters in your life, etc.

Feeling insecure? Talk about it! Having relationship issues? That's a good 
topic! Opening up definitely shouldn't only consist of discussing problems 
though (remember the thing about positivity?). Talking about aspirations and 
dreams is also great. And you may find that when you open up, the other person 
does too!

When I spoke to my friend [David](http://david-hu.com/){:target="_blank"} about 
this, he provided some wise insights:

> Although it may be a little uncomfortable initially to touch on these things — there’s sort of an activation energy — there’s a lot of therapeutic value from just confiding in someone/people in general. And in return, you get lots of interesting insight and perspectives from your friends. You feel closer to someone because you feel like they’re a part of you now — they carry some of your stories. They’re also more inclined to share some of their lives, and you realize that, well, everyone makes mistakes and everyone goes through some of the things/insecurities that you do.

There's a misconception that sharing your feelings is a sign of weakness. I 
daresay it's a sign of strength. It means you're not afraid of putting yourself 
out there. Even though there's always the chance that you could get hurt, you're 
willing to take that risk to connect emotionally with others.


##4. Profit!##

And that's it! Get in the right mindset to begin forming a friendship. Find 
conversation (interests) that you can both care about to become friends. Then 
open up to bring that friendship to the next level.

As a warning, you may find that following the previous steps over time will make 
you feel happier. If you've already followed them, then you should now have a 
new best friend. Congratulations!

Joking aside, I do hope these steps help you to build more meaningful 
friendships. Let me know if you think the process can be improved, or if the 
steps work for you!
