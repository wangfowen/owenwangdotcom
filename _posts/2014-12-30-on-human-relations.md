I spend a lot of time thinking about human relations because I am strongly 
influenced by the people around me. My drive, my worldviews, everything.

It's important to maintain strong relations with those around you, but it's also 
important to be always meeting new people. When I hang out with the same people 
too long, and we're too similar, I get stagnant.  Need to meet more people 
better at a variety of things / people offering different views.


I strongly believe connecting with other people is very important, and opening 
up to people is the key to doing so. Sometimes if you open up to the wrong 
people, that’ll come back to bite you, but I try to use my judge of character 
liberally.


Socializing is kind of like two people being mutually attracted. When one person 
talks about something, if the other person is just as interested on same topic, 
attraction happens and they’re able to converse. It doesn’t work if one person 
says something and the other doesn’t have anything to contribute. Getting better 
at socializing is being more well read so you have something to contribute no 
matter the subject.

Part of why I want to travel more is to be more worldly to be able to converse 
better with people. Getting better at conversation is finding common talking 
points by probing the things they're interested in instead of just what you are.  
Better if you're mutually interested. remembering them for the future is also 
key.
