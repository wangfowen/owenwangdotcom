They say it takes just seven seconds to form a first impression. These are the stories of my first look at a couple cities.

Lyon

Rome
Pouring rain

Fat standing person, skinny walking person
Branding not as big here. Most stores have same fonts - comic sans, etc. All simply named Hotel, Pizzeria, Bar (bar doesn't seem to mean what it does in English). Those keywords are also in bigger fonts than that of the name of the shops.
Street signs are terrible. Carved into buildings. Unreadable at night.

Copenhagen
