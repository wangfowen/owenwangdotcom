They say it takes just seven seconds to form a first impression. These are the stories of my first look at a couple cities.

Lyon
Crossing border easy
Navigating subway easy
When I hopped off the Tram and made my way towards INSA Lyon, I could not help but feel disappointed. I envisioned a stunning Chateau but instead got greeted by a campus that could give Waterloo a run for its money for [least sexy campus](http://thewaterloohonk.wordpress.com/2013/06/25/uwaterloo-officially-named-canadas-least-sexy-campus/). To be fair, my stay was brief and entirely in the administrative sector. Perhaps when I set foot in the main campus it will be a different story. "Boulevard du 11 novembre 1918" is by far the strangest street name I've ever seen.

The walk from INSA to Lyon's city center failed to impress. The streets were lined with grimy, graffitied buildings and archaic, dented cars. The only redeeming quality being model-esque French women striding along doing their business. I hereby knight Lyon with the honor of "Detroit's European cousin".
Here's an example of a street corner. 
30 seconds before I took the picture, there was even a French lady standing at the corner, but I didn't want to seem like too much of a creeper
Upon arriving at the city center, my opinion flipped 180. This was the Europe I dreamed of. Majestic monoliths ascending mountains, cobblestone bridges spanning crisp bodies of water.
Another aside, pedestrian cross walk signals amused me. They instantly change from green to red. There's no state in between that warns you to finish crossing quickly. The guy in the light also appears to be thinner than that of his North American counterpart.

Count of people walking with baguettes: 4
Count of couples full on making out in the street: 3

Rome
Pouring rain

Fat standing person, skinny walking person
Branding not as big here. Most stores have same fonts - comic sans, etc. All simply named Hotel, Pizzeria, Bar (bar doesn't seem to mean what it does in English). Those keywords are also in bigger fonts than that of the name of the shops.
Street signs are terrible. Carved into buildings. Unreadable at night.
