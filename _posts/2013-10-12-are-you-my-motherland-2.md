_In this [on-going series]({% post_url 2013-10-12-are-you-my-motherland %}) I 
examine some cities I've visited in the hopes of finding pride in my old homes 
or finding a new place to call home._

Roma, the city that kicked off our travels. Let us looketh at thy main 
distinctions.

## Airport ##

Security was non-existent. As in there literally was not a customs officer in 
the booth and I just walked straight through. I may have become an illegal 
alien? Oops.

Baggage claim is a nightmare. There's [a 
study](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/opinion/sunday/why-waiting-in-line-is-torture.html?pagewanted=all){:target="_blank"} 
that says:

> Often the psychology of queuing is more important than the statistics of the wait itself... Occupied time (walking to baggage claim) feels shorter than unoccupied time (standing at the carousel)

Romans clearly don't care about the psychological welfare of visitors. It takes 
just a couple minutes to reach baggage claim, and then you get this wait:

Quite an astounding statistic of wait already, even worse when its entirety is 
unoccupied.

## Architecture ##

As expected, every building is a mind-blowing mix of archaic and epic. Starting 
off in Rome might have been a bad idea; I became desensitized to magnificent 
architecture so other cities no longer seemed as impressive. One thing that 
surprised me was all the gargantuan giant-doors. Even the doors to historically 
unimportant buildings like our hostel could fit three of me stacked on top of 
each other. If that's not proof that humans coexisted with dinosaurs 2000 years 
ago, I don't know what is.


## Signs ##

Without my handy [maps app](http://mapswith.me/en/home) I have no idea how you'd 
get anywhere here. Each street corner has at most one sign designating the 
intersecting road and often none for the one you're on. Why don't they budget 
for more street signs you ask? Probably because they all look like this:

As an added bonus, this makes them completely unreadable at night.

Signs for bars, restaurants, and hotels all looked the same. "Hotel", "Bar", etc 
were all in a much larger font size than that of the actual name of the place, 
and the signs were all monochromatic in a plain font like Times New Roman. I 
think they're trying to appeal to drunk tourists, making it very obvious what 
kind of service is offered at the institution.


## Restaurants ##

In restaurants you do not get offered free tap water. The only water you can get 
is in bottles / costs money. If you find that upsetting, you can't passive 
aggressively express your discontent with a smaller tip because there _is_ no 
tipping. That didn't seem to affect the quality of service though, most of the 
waiters we had were still extremely jolly.

Menus look completely cluttered due to every item being translated into at least 
2 other languages. If after a couple days you get sick of pizza and pasta, good luck 
finding other kinds of food. People there seem to only eat Italian food. Even within the 
category of Italian food the choices are usually quite limited. You won't find deep dish 
pizzas or cheesy crust pizzas. All the pizzas are thin, (comparatively) healthy, and 
pretty plain. Maybe I've been brainwashed but I actually prefer the greasy ones you'd find 
in North America with all the crazy gimmicks like Butter Chicken flavored.

If a restaurant has air conditioning and/or free WiFi, they'll be sure to let 
you know with signs everywhere. Apparently those are huge selling points.


## Public Transportation ##

If you're touring, be sure to get a Roma Pass. It gives you access to museums 
and the Coliseum without having to go through the lines and it gives you free 
access to the public transportation. We only used the metro once so don't have 
much to say here. It seemed quite standard. The only thing worth noting is be 
careful of pickpockets. If a little kid asks you for the time and you clearly 
don't have a watch, immediately guard your valuables. His friends are probably 
surrounding you and stealing your belongings.


## Entertainment ##

Aside from the obvious museums and such, we did not find much else in terms of 
entertainment. Aimlessly wandering the city at night, we managed to find just 
one bar that was open, and it wasn't even midnight yet. The city seemed to 
completely die at night. Or maybe we just visited on the wrong night / in the 
wrong areas?


# Verdict #

Nope. Absolutely would not live here. Good times were had during my stay, but I 
would not be able to handle the crowdedness and constant paranoia of being pick 
pocketed on a daily basis. I'm now also glad Toronto at least has some semblance 
of a night life and a decent diversity of foods.
