As a young adult in the tech industry, I am grateful for the internships I get to work. I am granted decent hours and pay, don't have any physical strain, and I can do as I please when I'm off work as I don't yet have responsibilities. I can't speak for everyone in the industry, but within my circle my friends and I have developed what we call overpaid syndrome. If someone suggests an idea for something that sounds fun, we'd have a group of people instantly committed without a second thought. It doesn't matter the cost, as long as fun is guaranteed. This has resulted in everything from a weekend bungee jumping trip to a week long Hawaii excursion. Even some of our more frugal friends end up developing the syndrome after working in the Valley.
We don't value money anymore and spend it like it's nothing. It's terrible and we know it. I've developed a mentality where when I am forced to do something I don't enjoy, I think about how many work hours it would've taken to avoid it. Shopping for 3 hours to find the best deal? If I worked those 3 hours I could've just bought the best thing and it wouldn't have mattered whether it was on sale.
When I return home to my first generation Chinese-American household, I am often reminded how that $500 ski trip could've bought just about every electronic device in the house, and how my parents didn't spend even a tenth of that when they were my age. It's sometimes good to have things put in perspective. You realize when you've been foolish and too wasteful. 
Obviously those 3 hours spent shopping weren't spent working. You can't always be working. You still have to be cost-effective in purchases.
But I wouldn't say overpaid syndrome is all bad. It has let me learn to enjoy life as it happens. After a while, buying material possessions doesn't really get you much anymore. You instead enjoy experiences and make the most out of your time. Sometimes we just have to let loose and have some fun. 
Time is as much a commodity as other things. It is limited, and we only need to hoard so much wealth to be secure in ourselves. Why not spend the rest of it making more time for ourselves and enjoying ourselves?
A quote from a friend: 
Imagine there is a bank account that credits your account each morning with $86,400. It carries over no balance from day to day. Every evening the bank deletes whatever part of the balance you failed to use during the day. What would you do? Draw out every cent, of course? Each of us has such a bank. Its name is time. Every morning, it credits you with 86,400 seconds. Every night it writes off as lost, whatever of this you have failed to invest to a good purpose. It carries over no balance. It allows no over draft. Each day it opens a new account for you. Each night it burns the remains of the day. If you fail to use the day’s deposits, the loss is yours. There is no drawing against “tomorrow”. You must live in the present on today’s deposits. Invest it so as to get from it the utmost in health, happiness and success. The clock is running. Make the most of today.
This is of course easier to say when we are in a position of better finance, but 
fun doesn't require money. Some of the best adventures I've had involved minimal 
spending.
