Grovember has officially come to an end.  With over a month's worth of data 
collected, perhaps now I can gain some insights on my life. And of course, what 
fun would those be if they didn't come with some foxy graphs!

##Where is my time going?##

As you may recall from [Part 1]({% post_url 2013-11-21-grovember %}), my primary 
goals were programming, practicing French, and traveling. It appears I'm doing 
alright with the traveling, but not so hot with the rest. Sleep is inevitable, 
but I can work on cutting out "no goal". In fact, I have a sneaking suspicion 
that as this experiment progressed and I became more and more aware of where my 
time went, my wasted time decreased. Let's see if the data agrees.

The first week was our half-term break, so all the serious business traveling 
left no time to be wasted. After that, "no goal" spiked and indeed gradually 
came back down week by week.

"No goal" as the name implies means anything that doesn't achieve a goal of 
mine. This includes the range from grocery shopping to stalking people on 
Facebook, so not all of it can be completely removed -- Facebook is vital for 
survival. If I want to trim something out to make room for more goal-oriented 
work, for sure the first place to look for change is within my internet browsing 
habits. Here's a graph of how that breaks down:

My Facebook usage is frankly disgusting. I don't even know what I do on there 
all day. Facebook has been called [the tech equivalent of 
cigarettes](http://oznathan.quora.com/Facebook-is-the-21st-century-tech-equivalent-of-cigarettes-And-now-I-can-finally-prove-it){:target="\_blank"}, 
which just goes to show that if I ever got into smoking, I'd be a hopeless 
addict.

##Digging Deeper - Sleep##

By far my most time-consuming category is sleep. It accounts for 34% of my time!  
That's not necessarily good or bad, but maybe I could do "better" at it. [Sleep 
Cycle](http://www.sleepcycle.com/){:target="\_blank"} tracks my quality of 
sleep, so it probably wouldn't hurt to optimize that.

On average, I slept both the most and the best on __Tuesdays__. I slept the 
worst on __Saturday__ and the least on __Sunday__. On average I sleep 7.6 hours 
per day.

What factors affect my sleep?

How does my sleep affect the time I waste and my sociability?
Let's look at all of them plotted over time. If you find it too cluttered to

##The Social Network##

The second major activity on my charts is socializing. This includes everything 
from [YouTube parties](http://xkcd.com/920/){:target="\_blank"} to grabbing a 
pint at a bar.

__54%__ of the hours I was awake were spent with other people.

__47%__ of the days where I socialized with people involved drinking. I was most 
social on __Friday__ and least social on __Tuesday__. I drank the most often on 
__Friday__.

##Part 3?##

I didn't get conclusive answers on some of the deeper questions. One month's 
stats weren't enough to yield such trends. Therefore I'm going to keep up the 
data collection for another while longer and analyze again in a month or two. If 
I get some fascinating new findings I'll make another post, but most likely it 
won't be worth sharing. Who knows. With the insights from this, I may experience 
drastic changes.

I'm considering adding more daily measurements as well -- my mood, my focus, 
etc. But those are very subjective, and can vary too much throughout the day, so 
it'd be hard to get an accurate depiction. I've seen [TagTime](http://tagti.me) 
and [Reporter](http://www.reporter-app.com/) but I don't think those are the 
solutions for me. I'd rather not be attached at the hips to my phone, and they 
seem like massive focus-breaking context switchers. If anyone knows of other 
solutions, I'd be happy to hear about them. I can be reached [via
