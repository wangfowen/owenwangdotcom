I'm going to try to do a mix of vlogs and written blog posts when I'm in Europe. To test out embedded Youtube videos, here's one my friend Xuehai and I made for our cottage trip this past weekend.

It was my first time at a cottage - with friends at that. I don't think I could have asked for a better experience. Sean's place was decked out with everything you'd ever want and more. There was a tiki bar, sail boat, jet skis, beach volleyball court, full kitchen, campfire, and enough beds for 10 people. We might as well have been at a 5 star resort.

I won't go into specifics of what all went down, I think the video does that pretty well already. I can't believe how musically talented everyone was. At any given time there was always someone singing. Even menial chores seemed more fun with the euphonic background music. If only I could have someone follow me around at all times singing like that... (startup idea?)

The weekend was filled with much laughter and good vibes. A++ would definitely do again!
