This is a topic that's been floating through my mind lately, and I wanted to 
form some structure around my jumbled thoughts on it as I begin to think about 
my next job (I'll be job hunting in a month or so). I had life quite good at 
Nest, and I still love what they're doing, but for my next career move I want to 
work towards righting what I perceive as a wrong in the world.

I'm also writing this to request recommendations for relevant readings or tech 
job openings. I know I'm not the only one that's been thinking about it, I'd 
like to hear the thoughts of others that are.

I was watching Pursuit of Happyness a while back, and one scene particularly 
stood out to me. Will Smith was forced to sleep in a public bathroom with his 
son for a night because they couldn't afford to pay rent anymore and they 
couldn't get a spot in the shelter that night. Seriously A+ acting on his part, 
the shame and tears in his eyes at having had to resort to such felt so real.

Another similarly poignant moment was from the show Atlanta. Donald Glover's 
character Earn was looking to make some quick cash from a pawn shop, and his 
friend Darius told him he could make him way more. In the end it turned out 
Darius invested that money in a dog that'd be worth $4000 down the line, to 
which Earn responded:

> Van needed that money. My daughter needed that money. Not in September, but 
> today. See, I'm poor, Darius. And poor people don't have time for investments 
> because poor people are too busy trying not to be poor. I need to eat today, 
> not in September.

Without financial stability, basic survival needs like finding food and shelter 
occupy so much of ones' brain space, there's no other time and energy to think 
about the future and moving up in life.

While traveling recently, it became more evident than ever the difference 
afforded by my financial state. When we visited third world countries, things we 
normally take for granted like hot, clean, running water were a luxury. But the 
contrast wasn't just evident at that scale, even compared to other travelers we 
met in hostels, we had so many less worries having the financial backing from a 
tech salary. Instead of figuring out how to take a series of shared cars to get 
to a remote region, we could just splurge on a taxi. When we stayed in a run 
down hostel, it was for the experience and out of choice, not because it was all 
we could afford if we wanted to keep the trip going.

I read a lot of self-help material and so much of it talks about being positive 
and having confidence. Yet from talking to some friends from lower income 
families, I came to see that such advice is meaningless and impossible when 
you're not in a good state. It's not really something you can fake it til you 
make it. If so much of your previous experience has pointed at outcomes turning 
out negatively, you'd be delusional to try and be positive. If one mistake would 
bring your whole livelihood crashing down, how can you be confident that things 
will get better? If so much of your well being is outside of your control, how 
can you feel like anything is possible?

In simpler times, I used to think that the world would be a better place if 
everyone just made the same income. But I came to see that capitalism overall 
does better for pushing the world along, and wealth disparity is at the heart of 
capitalism. Income inequality does a good job at motivating people to make 
changes in their lives and not remain stagnant.

As my thoughts on the topic matured, I began to see what I really had a problem 
with was not the gap in wealth, but the gap in opportunities available seemingly 
due to the gap in wealth. Everyone has their own problems, and that will never 
change, but when the problems are life and death, decisions are more 
consequential and risks aren't as easily afforded.

TODO
Research about happiness above 70k. The way I interpret that now is because 
people above that line don't have to worry about life and death, so there's a 
stability in which their minds can be at rest.

THIS SECTION ISN'T GREAT. SHOULD TIE BETTER TO EARLIER CONTENT. AND TALK ABOUT 
HOW I CAN TAKE OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS BECAUSE I HAVE MENTAL ENERGY.
I was able to focus full time on my education because I didn't have other 
problems weighing on me. And having gotten the education, I could try for jobs I 
wasn't yet qualified for. I'm able to take half a year off from working to 
travel because I'm confident I can still get a job when I'm back. Or even if I 
can't, I won't die because I have a home I can stay at until I figure things out 
again. Even the fact that I can take the risk in expending mental space in 
thinking about inequality is because everything else in my life is secure 
enough.

TALK ABOUT HOW I CAN DO ALL THAT BECAUSE I HAVE A SAFETY NET PROVIDED BY 
PARENTS. THAT SAFETY NET DOESN'T EXIST FOR EVERYONE, AND THAT'S THE WRONG I WANT 
TO RIGHT.
But that safety net doesn't exist for everyone. For some, if they fall, that's 
it. They're screwed. So they can't take the opportunities in front of them. For 
some there aren't even the same opportunities laid out for them the way they 
were by my parents and by my school and the connections that resulted from it.
The idea of the American Dream is nice, where anyone that works hard can move up 
in the world, but it doesn't currently apply to everyone.  __I want the American 
Dream to become a reality for everyone__.


I don't expect this to fix all of the world's problems, humans are darned good 
at creating new ones for themselves, but I would like to think it'd make things 
fairer at least.

So what does it take to get there? That's where my thoughts are not still 
completely clear and I need the help of you, dear reader. I have some broad 
ideas, but I don't have many specifics.

- Improve mental health so that people can bounce back
- Improve the state of health care so that if someone is sick, it doesn't ruin 
  their life. Stat from Option B about $400.
- Improve access to education so that if everything else is stable, and they 
  make an effort, they can gain the skills to open up new opportunities.
- Provide shelters for people so they can not worry about survival. Or maybe 
  just universal basic income would suffice in this front. We worry about such a 
  thing being squandered on some, where they just blow it on drugs. Well, if 
  they do, so be it. At least the opportunity to do otherwise was provided to 
  them.
- End systemic racism. I'm lucky enough where being pulled over by a cop is just 
  another regular occurrence, where I don't have to fear for my life ending 
  after no wrong doing.
- Provide platforms to underprivileged for them to be able to congregate to 
  address problems. I don't fully understand the problems of other groups, all I 
  can do is elevate their voices and allow them to solve their own problems 
  better. There's a lot of research that shows community helps people build 
  resilience and overcome their challenges, help people feel less isolated.

These are very very broad problems with a lot of people already working on them.  
I don't expect myself to contribute to all of them, but I'd like to work on 
something that's directionally correct. So this is where I need recommendations 
from you, dear reader. Please let me know if you know of related readings or 
tech job openings!

I can understand the argument of the other side saying how expensive it is to 
give free handouts to everyone, but these are the same free handouts we got, 
just from our parents instead of from society. And not everyone is as lucky to 
have such families. I don't think everything in life should be spoon fed to us, 
but at least enough of a safety net should be in place for people to be able to 
try and do the same things I do. For there to be opportunity equality.
