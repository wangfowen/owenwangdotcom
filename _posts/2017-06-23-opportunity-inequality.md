This is a topic that's been floating through my mind lately, and I wanted to 
form some structure around my jumbled thoughts on it, as well as request from 
anyone reading this recommendations for relevant readings or tech job openings 
(I'll be job hunting in a month or so).

I was watching Pursuit of Happyness a while back, and one scene particularly 
stood out to me. Will Smith was forced to sleep in a bathroom with his son for a 
night because they couldn't afford to pay rent anymore and they couldn't get a 
spot in the shelter that night. Seriously A+ acting on his part, the shame and 
tears in his eyes at having had to resort to this felt so real.

By not having financial stability, even basic survival needs like finding 
shelter and food occupy ones' brain space, there's no other time and energy to 
think about the future and moving up in life.

Another similar scene that got me thinking about this was from Atlanta. Donald 
Glover's character Earn was looking to make some quick cash from a pawn shop, 
and his friend Darius told him he could make him way more. In the end it turned 
out Darius invested that money in a dog that'd be worth $4000 down the line, to 
which Earn responded:

> Van needed that money. My daughter needed that money. Not in September, but 
> today. See, I'm poor, Darius. And poor people don't have time for investments 
> because poor people are too busy trying not to be poor. I need to eat today, 
> not in September.

While traveling recently, it became more evident than ever the difference 
between having financial security and not. When we visited third world 
countries, things we normally take for granted like hot, clean, running water 
were a luxury. But the contrast wasn't just evident at that scale, even compared 
to other travelers we met in hostels, we had so many less worries having the 
financial backing from a tech salary. Instead of figuring out how to take a 
series of shared cars to get to a remote region, we could just splurge on a 
taxi. When we stayed in a run down hostel, it was for the experience and out of 
choice, not because it was all we could afford.

I read a lot of self-help material and so much of it talks about being positive 
and having confidence.
Yet from talking to some lower income friends, I came to see that such advice is 
meaningless and impossible when you're not in a good state. It's not really 
something you can fake it til you make it. If you make a mistake and suddenly 
that brings everything crashing down, how can you possibly be positive or be 
confident that things will get better? If so much of your well being are outside 
of your control, how can you feel like anything is possible?

In simpler times, I used to think that the world would be a better place if 
everyone just made the same income.
But I came to see that capitalism overall does better for pushing the world 
along. The income inequality is what motivates people to try and move up.

As my thoughts on the topic matured, I began to see what I really wanted was for 
people to not have to worry about basic survival. For everyone to move up in 
Maslow's hierarchy of needs. I want people to be able to take risks and not 
worry about whether or not that'd mean they'd be able to have a place to live if 
they took it. To have a basic safety net. That's what I had, and I think that's 
a big part of the whole discussion on privilege. The problem isn't that our 
incomes are unequal, but that our opportunities are.

I'd like to think I worked hard to get where I am, but I didn't get here alone. 
My success is built on the shoulders of giants &mdash; my parents for coming to 
America/Canada, my school for providing me the opportunities, etc. And the 
reason I'm able to take risks is because I have a safety net, knowing that if I 
fail, I can still get back up. I can take half a year off to go traveling 
because I'm confident I still have a job when I'm back, and that even if that 
doesn't work out, I can stay with my parents or friends until I figure things 
out again. Even the fact that I have mental space to think about inequality in 
the world is because I'm in a good place as a result of everything else.

I want the American Dream to actually be a reality for everyone. That if you 
work hard, you can actually move up.

So what does it take to get there? That's where my thoughts are not still 
completely clear and I need the help of you, dear reader. I have some broad 
ideas, but I don't have many specifics.

- Improve mental health so that people can bounce back
- Improve the state of health care so that if someone is sick, it doesn't ruin 
  their life. Stat from Option B about $400.
- Improve access to education so that if everything else is stable, and they 
  make an effort, they can gain the skills to open up new opportunities.
- Provide shelters for people so they can not worry about survival. Or maybe 
  just universal basic income would suffice in this front. We worry about such a 
  thing being squandered on some, where they just blow it on drugs. Well, if 
  they do, so be it. At least the opportunity to do otherwise was provided to 
  them.
- End systemic racism. I'm lucky enough where being pulled over by a cop is just 
  another regular occurrence, where I don't have to fear for my life ending 
  after no wrong doing.
- Provide platforms to underprivileged for them to be able to congregate to 
  address problems. I don't fully understand the problems of other groups, all I 
  can do is elevate their voices and allow them to solve their own problems 
  better. There's a lot of research that shows community helps people build 
  resilience and overcome their challenges, help people feel less isolated.

If you have recommendations for related readings or know of tech job openings 
related to any of these, please let me know.

I can understand the argument of the other side saying how expensive it is to 
give free handouts to everyone, but these are the same free handouts we got, 
just from our parents instead of from society. And not everyone is as lucky to 
have such families. I don't think everything in life should be spoon fed to us, 
but at least enough of a safety net should be in place for people to be able to 
try and do the same things I do. For there to be opportunity equality.
