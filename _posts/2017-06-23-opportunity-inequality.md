This is a topic that's been floating through my mind lately, and I wanted to 
form some structure around my world view of it as I begin to think about my next 
career (I'll be job hunting in a month or so).

I'm also writing this to request from you, dear reader, recommendations for 
relevant readings or tech job openings. My thoughts are just from the limited 
I've read, conversations with others, and what's formed in my own head. I'd love 
to hear solutions from others that are better informed.

##Income Inequality

I was watching Pursuit of Happyness a while back, and one scene particularly 
stood out to me. Will Smith was forced to sleep in a public bathroom with his 
son for a night because an unfortunate setback caused him to be unable to afford 
rent, and they couldn't get a spot in the homeless shelter that night. Seriously 
A+ acting on his part, the shame and tears in his eyes at having had to resort 
to that felt so real, the fear of not being able to provide even the basic 
necessities for his son.

Another similarly poignant moment was from the show Atlanta. Donald Glover's 
character Earn was looking to make some quick cash from a pawn shop, and his 
friend Darius told him he could make him way more than what the store offered. 
In the end it turned out Darius invested that money in a dog that'd be worth 
$4000 down the line, to which Earn responded:

> Van needed that money. My daughter needed that money. Not in September, but 
> today. See, I'm poor, Darius. And poor people don't have time for investments 
> because poor people are too busy trying not to be poor. I need to eat today, 
> not in September.

While I can't relate to either of these events having not experienced anything 
quite like them myself, I was left with an unsettled feeling thinking about how 
without financial stability, basic survival needs like finding food and shelter 
cause so much strife that it's hard to consider other aspects of life like 
investing in the future, which I so easily take for granted as a given to be 
doing.

While traveling recently, it became more evident than ever the difference 
afforded by my financial state. When we visited third world countries, something 
as simple as hot, clean, running water was sometimes a luxury. But the contrast 
wasn't just evident at that scale. Even compared to other travelers we met in 
hostels, we had so many less worries having the finances from a tech salary. 
Instead of stressing over the series of shared cars required to get to a remote 
region, we could just splurge on a taxi to get us there. When we stayed in a run 
down hostel, it was for the experience and out of choice, not because it was all 
we could afford if we wanted to keep the trip going.

In simpler times, I used to think that the world would be a better place if 
everyone just made the same income. But I came to see that capitalism overall 
does better for allowing society to self correct issues it faces, and wealth 
disparity is at the heart of capitalism. Income inequality motivates people to 
make changes in their lives and not remain stagnant.

As my thoughts on the topic matured, I began to see what I really had a problem 
with was not the income inequality, but the opportunity inequality that 
seemingly resulted from the gap in income. The idea of the American Dream is 
nice, where anyone that works hard can move up in the world. But it doesn't 
apply to everyone currently. Not everyone gets the opportunities to move up even 
when they work their hardest, and some can't take the opportunities even if 
they're there because of other factors. __I want the American Dream to become 
something that's possible for everyone__.

##Opportunities Available

Of course not everyone will get the exact same opportunities in life, nor would 
it make sense to. But in the ideal world, two people with the exact same 
qualifications doing the exact same job should?

EXAMPLE WHERE THAT'S NOT THE CASE?

STATS ABOUT HOW THERE'S NO ROOM TO MOVE UP IN LIFE

Issue here is being poor you don't get the same kinds of shots to get off the 
ground.

STATS ABOUT LESS OPPORTUNITIES

##Opportunities Taken

Everyone has their own problems, and that will never change, but when the 
problems are life and death, decisions are more consequential and risks aren't 
as easily afforded, so opportunities are sometimes passed over.

I'm a bit of a junkie for self-help material and much of it talks about being 
positive and having confidence, just embracing risks. Yet from talking to some 
friends from lower income families, I came to see that such advice is impossible 
to follow when you're not in a good state. It's not really something you can 
fake it til you make it. If so much of your previous experience has pointed at 
outcomes turning out negatively, you'd be delusional to bank on positivity 
changing things. If one mistake would bring your whole livelihood crashing down, 
how can you be confident that things will get better?  If so much of your well 
being is outside of your control, how can you feel like anything is possible?

There's research that shows that making above $75,000 a year doesn't impact 
happiness, but making more money does make a large difference up til that point. 
The way I interpret that now is because people below it still have money 
weighing on their minds, influencing every decision they make.

I was able to focus full time on my education because I didn't have such 
problems weighing on me, and that led me to further opportunities. I'm able to 
take half a year off from working to travel because I don't have anyone 
depending on me for survival, and I'm confident I can still get a job when I'm 
back. Or even if I can't, I won't die because I have a home I can stay at until 
I figure things out again. __Even the fact that I have mental space in thinking 
about inequality is because everything else in my life is secure enough.__

And everything is secure enough because I have a safety net, provided by my 
friends and family. But that safety net doesn't exist for everyone. For some, if 
they fall, that's it, it's hard to recover. So they can't take the opportunities 
in front of them. My belief is society should provide that safety net for 
everyone, since not everyone has the family to provide it.

##Solutions

This is the part I'm still very gray about. Most things that help one faction 
come at the expense of another. I don't think shaming or guilting someone for 
having life better is productive, but discussions do have to happen that will 
cause unpleasant feelings. Ideally we'd be able to arrive at win-win solutions, 
but I don't have specific solutions myself, just vague murmurs of the concepts.


To provide a safety net for everyone, we need to:
- Improve the state of mental health help available
- Improve the state of health care so that if someone is sick, it doesn't ruin 
  their life. TODO Stat from Option B about $400.
- Improve access to education so that if everything else is stable, and they 
  make an effort, they can gain the skills to open up new opportunities.
- Provide shelters for people so they can not worry about survival. Or maybe 
  just universal basic income would suffice in this front. We worry about such a 
  thing being squandered on some, where they just blow it on drugs. Well, if 
  they do, so be it. At least the opportunity to do otherwise was provided to 
  them.

To equalize the opportunities available for everyone:
- End systemic discrimination. I'm lucky enough where being pulled over by a cop 
  is just another regular occurrence, where I don't have to fear for my life 
  ending after no wrong doing, which significantly reduces my mental strain. I 
  can apply for a job and not be rejected on the sole basis of a mistake I made 
  20 years ago.
- Provide platforms to underprivileged for them to be able to congregate to 
  address problems. I don't fully understand the problems of other groups, all I 
  can do is elevate their voices and allow them to solve their own problems 
  better. There's a lot of research that shows community helps people build 
  resilience and overcome their challenges, help people feel less isolated.
- Provide platforms to fund and create opportunities for people to get started 
  in making a living

These are clearly very very broad ideas with a lot of people already working on 
them. I don't expect myself to contribute to all of them, but I'd like to work 
on something that's directionally correct.

I recognize tech isn't necessarily even the right solution for most of these 
problems, so if I truly wanted to make a change, I may consider changing 
professions. But currently I still believe tech can help in building tools 
towards these issues, and I'm not yet willing to completely let go of all the 
comfort and privileges a tech job allows me.

So this is where I need recommendations from you. Please let me know if you know 
of related readings or tech job openings! What else can be done to help that I 
didn't list, and what in each of these categories is already being done? Or am I 
wrong about these being things that may help?

I don't expect fixing opportunity inequality to fix all of the world's problems 
&mdash; humans are darned good at creating new ones for themselves &mdash; but I 
would like to think it'd make things fairer at least. Even though the world
will never be completely fair, as bad things will continue to happen to good 
people, I'd like to at least contribute to making it fairer where it's within 
society's control.
