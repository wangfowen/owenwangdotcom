This is a topic that's been floating through my mind lately, and I wanted to 
form some structure around my world view of it as I begin to think about my next 
job (I'll be job hunting in a month or so). I had life quite good at Nest, and I 
still love what they're doing, but for my next career move I want to work 
towards righting what I perceive as a wrong in the world.

I'm also writing this to request from you recommendations for relevant readings 
or tech job openings. I know I'm not the only one that's been thinking about it, 
I'd like to hear the thoughts of others that are.

##Income Inequality

I was watching Pursuit of Happyness a while back, and one scene particularly 
stood out to me. Will Smith was forced to sleep in a public bathroom with his 
son for a night because an unfortunate setback caused him to be unable to afford 
rent, and they couldn't get a spot in the homeless shelter that night. Seriously 
A+ acting on his part, the shame and tears in his eyes at having had to resort 
to that felt so real, the fear of not being able to provide even the basic 
necessities for his son.

Another similarly poignant moment was from the show Atlanta. Donald Glover's 
character Earn was looking to make some quick cash from a pawn shop, and his 
friend Darius told him he could make him way more than what the store offered. 
In the end it turned out Darius invested that money in a dog that'd be worth 
$4000 down the line, to which Earn responded:

> Van needed that money. My daughter needed that money. Not in September, but 
> today. See, I'm poor, Darius. And poor people don't have time for investments 
> because poor people are too busy trying not to be poor. I need to eat today, 
> not in September.

Without financial stability, basic survival needs like finding food and shelter 
cause so much strife, it's hard to consider other aspects of life like investing 
in the future.

While traveling recently, it became more evident than ever the difference 
afforded by my financial backing from a tech salary. When we visited third world 
countries, something as simple as hot, clean, running water which we normally 
take for granted was a luxury.

But the contrast wasn't just evident at that scale, even compared to other 
travelers we met in hostels, we had so many less worries having abundant 
finances. Instead of stressing over the series of shared cars required to get to 
a remote region, we could just splurge on a taxi to get us there. When we stayed 
in a run down hostel, it was for the experience and out of choice, not because 
it was all we could afford if we wanted to keep the trip going.

RESEARCH ABOUT IS THE INCOME GAP ACTUALLY INCREASING?

In simpler times, I used to think that the world would be a better place if 
everyone just made the same income. But I came to see that capitalism overall 
does better for pushing the world along, and wealth disparity is at the heart of 
capitalism. Income inequality motivates people to make changes in their lives 
and not remain stagnant.

As my thoughts on the topic matured, I began to see what I really had a problem 
with was not the income inequality, but the opportunity inequality that 
seemingly resulted from the gap in income. The idea of the American Dream is 
nice, where anyone that works hard can move up in the world. But it doesn't 
apply to everyone currently. Not everyone gets the opportunity to work their 
hardest because of outside circumstances, and for some, even when they do give 
it their best shot, they don't get the same opportunities to move up. __I want 
the American Dream to become something that's possible for everyone__.

NOT HAVING OPPORTUNITY TO WORK HARDEST ISN'T QUITE SAME AS NOT TAKING 
OPPORTUNITIES, THINK ABOUT REWORDING
##Opportunities Taken

Everyone has their own problems, and that will never change, but when the 
problems are life and death, decisions are more consequential and risks aren't 
as easily afforded, so opportunities are sometimes passed over.

I'm a bit of a junkie for self-help material and much of it talks about being 
positive and having confidence. Yet from talking to some friends from lower 
income families, I came to see that such advice is meaningless and impossible 
when you're not in a good state. It's not really something you can fake it til 
you make it. If so much of your previous experience has pointed at outcomes 
turning out negatively, you'd be delusional to try and be positive. If one 
mistake would bring your whole livelihood crashing down, how can you be 
confident that things will get better? If so much of your well being is outside 
of your control, how can you feel like anything is possible?

Research about happiness above 70k. The way I interpret that now is because 
people above that line don't have to worry about life and death, so there's a 
stability in which their minds can be at rest.

THIS SECTION ISN'T GREAT. SHOULD TIE BETTER TO EARLIER CONTENT. AND TALK ABOUT 
HOW I CAN TAKE OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS BECAUSE I HAVE MENTAL ENERGY.
I was able to focus full time on my education because I didn't have other 
problems weighing on me. And having gotten the education, I could try for jobs I 
wasn't yet qualified for. I'm able to take half a year off from working to 
travel because I'm confident I can still get a job when I'm back. Or even if I 
can't, I won't die because I have a home I can stay at until I figure things out 
again. Even the fact that I can take the risk in expending mental space in 
thinking about inequality is because everything else in my life is secure 
enough.

TALK ABOUT HOW I CAN DO ALL THAT BECAUSE I HAVE A SAFETY NET PROVIDED BY 
PARENTS. THAT SAFETY NET DOESN'T EXIST FOR EVERYONE, AND THAT'S THE WRONG I WANT 
TO RIGHT.
But that safety net doesn't exist for everyone. For some, if they fall, that's 
it. They're screwed. So they can't take the opportunities in front of them.

##Opportunities Available

For some there aren't even the same opportunities laid out for them the way they 
were by my parents and by my school and the connections that resulted from it. 
It's easier to make money when you have money. Trump is a self-made man, except 
for the million dollar loan he got from his dad.

Issue here is being poor you don't get the same kinds of shots to get off the 
ground.

STATS ABOUT LESS OPPORTUNITIES

##Solutions

This is the part I'm still very gray about. Most things that help one faction 
come at the expense of another. I have general ideas of what can help, but I 
don't have specific solutions.

- Improve mental health so that people can bounce back
- Improve the state of health care so that if someone is sick, it doesn't ruin 
  their life. TODO Stat from Option B about $400.
- Improve access to education so that if everything else is stable, and they 
  make an effort, they can gain the skills to open up new opportunities.
- Provide shelters for people so they can not worry about survival. Or maybe 
  just universal basic income would suffice in this front. We worry about such a 
  thing being squandered on some, where they just blow it on drugs. Well, if 
  they do, so be it. At least the opportunity to do otherwise was provided to 
  them.
- End systemic discrimination. I'm lucky enough where being pulled over by a cop 
  is just another regular occurrence, where I don't have to fear for my life 
  ending after no wrong doing, which significantly reduces my mental strain. I 
  can apply for a job and not be rejected on the sole basis of a mistake I made 
  20 years ago.
- Provide platforms to underprivileged for them to be able to congregate to 
  address problems. I don't fully understand the problems of other groups, all I 
  can do is elevate their voices and allow them to solve their own problems 
  better. There's a lot of research that shows community helps people build 
  resilience and overcome their challenges, help people feel less isolated.
- Provide platforms to fund and create opportunities for people to get started 
  in making a living

These are clearly very very broad problems with a lot of people already working 
on them. I don't expect myself to contribute to all of them, but I'd like to 
work on something that's directionally correct. So this is where I need 
recommendations from you, Please let me know if you know of related readings or 
tech job openings! What else can be done to help that I didn't list, and what in 
each of these categories is already being done? Or am I wrong about these being 
things that may help?

I don't expect fixing opportunity inequality to fix all of the world's problems 
&mdash; humans are darned good at creating new ones for themselves &mdash; but I 
would like to think it'd make things fairer at least. The world will never be 
completely fair, as bad things will continue to happen to good people, but some 
things are within society's control, so all I can hope for is we at least make 
those parts fairer. Or at least all I can do is try and contribute to those 
myself.
