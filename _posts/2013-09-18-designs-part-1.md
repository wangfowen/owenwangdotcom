One of my favorite activities while traveling is observing oddities in cities;
things that differ from what I'm used to, things that help me appreciate what 
I've taken for granted. We've noticed in our travels that there are some 
universal constants: Comic Sans in restaurant logos (why would anyone do 
this??), pigeons, McDonald's, iPhones, American pop music.
This is the first in a three part series on looking at the differences in some 
of the cities I've visited.

Ah, Lyon. My new home for the next 5 months.

When I hopped off the Tram and made my way towards INSA Lyon, I could not help 
but feel disappointed. I envisioned a stunning Chateau but instead got greeted 
by a campus that beats out Waterloo for [least sexy 
campus](http://thewaterloohonk.wordpress.com/2013/06/25/uwaterloo-officially-named-canadas-least-sexy-campus/).
INSA is technically in Villeurbanne though, so I will leave that for a different 
post (spoiler: it's practically a European Detroit). Let's take a look at just 
Lyon itself.

__Airport__
Crossing border easy, baggage claim fast, airport clean.

__Metro__
Navigating subway easy. Clear signs, albeit sometimes mislead with time 
predictions.

__Street Signs__
Very clear, much like those seen in North America. I don't understand this 
street though: GET PICTURE OF 11 NOVEMBRE

__Pedestrian Lights__
They instantly change from green to red. There's no state in between that warns 
you to finish crossing quickly. The guy in the light also appears to be thinner 
than that of his North American counterpart.

__Restaurants__
Menus are typically bilingual, nothing out of the ordinary here. Not really a 
design issue, but all prices include tax (this turns out to be a common pattern 
everywhere outside of North America. Get your act together 'murica!). Tipping is 
encouraged, yet if you pay with card there's no spot to add tip.

People walking with baguettes: 4 (counted over the course of an hour)
