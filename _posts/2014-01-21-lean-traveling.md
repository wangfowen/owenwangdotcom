If an interview ever asked me my biggest weakness, I'd probably walk out on the 
spot. I could rant for days about how awful and pointless that question is for 
judging candidates.

But if I ever really had to give an answer, it'd be that I sometimes suck when 
it comes to paying attention. My most recent trip alone I'd say cost myself an 
extra $100 at least in lost belongings and misread / unread directions (link to 
story). (Please still hire me employers, I'm very tedious when it comes to code 
I promise).

In order to make up for my carelessness, I try to keep myself organized with 
lists and guides so there's less room for screwing up. Since traveling has been 
a huge part of my life recently, I've made many lists for it. Here I've 
aggregated them and I share my guidelines for traveling with minimum stress and 
maximal fun. Most are probably obvious for seasoned travelers.

__Keep your plans as barebone as possible (Minimum viable plan) then iterate on 
them.__
The extent of my concrete plans are usually when will I get to a place, where 
will I stay, and when will I leave. Though sometimes not even these. It may just 
be the overpaid syndrome (link) talking but I find reservations get in the way. 
I'm not saying to not plan. I tripadvisor places before I go and I ask friends 
for recommendations. From those I make a list of everything that interests me, 
  and estimate how many I can squeeze in a day, but I avoid reservations unless 
  it's absolutely necessary.  You'll always hear about awesome things to do, new 
  places to go, and even just meet new people who you may unexpectedly spend 
  hours talking to when you're on the road so it's better to leave room for 
  spontaneity. Some of my most enjoyable days were the ones where we met locals 
  and they showed us around.  If you hear or see something interesting, do it 
  and adjust your plan accordingly after. Many times I hear about something and 
  plan to do it later, and over half the time it ends up not happening.  If you 
  do make a list, don't expect to do everything on it and don't be disappointed 
    when you don't.  This might just be a tip for myself. As people I went to 
    Hawaii with can attest, I was big on check lists and doing everything on it. 
    I've gotten a bit better at just relaxing and enjoying whatever is happening 
    as it happens now. If you're on vacation, why bog myself down with negative 
    emotions. And it comes down to would I really have traded any of the time I 
    spent for something else that I don't actually know if I'd have enjoyed? The 
    answer has always been no. 

__Don't have any single points of failure.__ I use tripit to aggregate all my 
hostel and transportation info but I also have a written copy of my itinerary 
and key contacts for each. Keep photocopies of your passport and other important 
documents in your bag and keep a small stash of emergency money just in case you 
get robbed (knock on wood). 

__Minimize belongings.__ There are very few things you actually _need_. 
Everything I consider vital for my travels I carry on my person - passport, 
phone, wallet. Whenever I go anywhere I just do a pat down and I know I'm good 
to go. If I lose anything else the trip can still go on. Other important things 
you can't fit on your person keep in the inner most pockets of your bags and 
don't keep anything important in your back pockets. Pick pockets love it when 
you do.  Clothes will be the biggest space hoarder. In order to minimize clothes 
yet still be ready for all weathers, consider bringing one of every type of 
clothing and just layer up. This is probably why I'm single, but when I'm 
traveling, looking good is not my primary concern.
Checklist of things to not forget before you leave
- make list an I frame that can be shared separately. checkbox red when not 
  done. Green when done. Strike through when done. 

__Consider all possibilities when booking transportation.__
Flying may seem to be the fastest method, but airports are completely broken. 
Security, customs, and the fact that airports are always out of the city make 
times not nearly as short as advertised. Trains on the other hand are usually in 
the center of the city and you can just hop on minutes before departure. If 
you're worried about the time loss, try overnight ones, so you don't lose travel 
time and even save on costs for a night of stay.  Advice for trains in Europe: 
Eurail is great when you use it properly. You can essentially hop on any train, 
show the pass, and be good to go. You have to pay extra for reservations, so 
it's as if they're encouraging you to be more spontaneous with plans! Overnight 
trains often require a reservation though, and ones in France aren't worth 
getting reservations as they cost almost as much as the full price. You might as 
well buy the tickets from scnf if you really want things pre-booked.
Buses don't have beds but often are the cheapest. If you pass out cold no matter 
the sleeping position, this is a good one also.  Shorter distances there's 
blablacar as well. Link to Jamie's article

Checklist of things to double check when buying tickets:
Make sure booked for right day right am/pm right date in the right system
Make sure booked in right direction
Make sure booked for right place and not similarly named place
Check different sources. Eurail is awful for France

__Give yourself wiggle room.__ If you minimized the amount of plans set in 
stone, you also have less deadlines. But things like flights can't be avoided. 
My general rule of thumb is be at a train station 30 min prior to departure if 
not retrieving ticket (sometimes they do crazy things like not show your stop if 
it's not the final destination or have a different train number if the train 
splits into parts transformers-style halfway through), 1 hour when retrieving, 1 
hour for flights within the EU or within a nation. International flights 2 hours 
prior. It may seem like wasted sight seeing time but I can't imagine a bigger 
waste of time and money than missing your ride. And there are plenty of ways you 
can entertain yourself while waiting. Like write guides.

__Venture farther out for food__. Not only do you get more authentic food, also 
better for your wallet. Graph of  distance vs old ness and how that affects 
quality/cheapness of food 

__Lastly, enjoy yourself!__ after you travel for extended periods, bad things 
may happen. Stuff gets stolen, people are racist. Try to stay positive and not 
let them get you down. You're seeing a new place! It's amazing! As said before, 
as long as you still have your wallet and passport, everything is manageable.
