As I said in my [previous post](/blog/20-14-hindsight), I spent a lot of time 
reflecting about improving relationships this past year. It started with this 
Twitter conversation I eavesdropped upon between my friend Jonathan and someone 
named Nav:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/wikichen">@wikichen</a> Dude, how do you make CLOSE friends with people? Beyond the small-talk and how is your weekend crap? Been bothering me for time.</p>&mdash; Nav Dhillon (@Navjotd) <a href="https://twitter.com/Navjotd/status/445673386547503104">March 17, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I of course nosily inserted myself into the conversation. Not knowing how to 
properly use Twitter, my responses aren't coherent enough to paste here. I 
essentially advised that if you open yourself up to others, close friendships 
will naturally form. Ironically, I later met Nav in real life, and I did not 
follow my own advice.

In thinking more about the subject, I've decided it's not as simple as the one 
step of just opening up... it's actually 3 steps! (I'm sure in reality there's 
much more involved, but then it wouldn't be able to go viral on BuzzFeed, would 
it?)

Before we get into the three steps that will change your life, why am I writing 
about this? Well, as my college days comes to an end, and as I enter the adult 
world, I'll have to make new friends again. What a bummer. To make things worse, 
this time I won't have the magnetic pull of school to bring people into my 
proximity. Perhaps consolidating my thoughts here will help me prepare for the 
days to come, and perhaps it'll help others do the same.

Making friends can be hard. I'm sure Nav is not alone in wanting to be able to 
get closer to people. Friends [ameliorate bad 
situations](http://www.centreforconfidence.co.uk/flourishing-lives.php?p=cGlkPTIwMSZpZD03ODg=){:target="_blank"}, 
and they [make good situations even 
better](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/without-friends-or-family-even-extraordinary-experiences-are-disappointing/){:target="_blank"}.

If you already have a close social group, you may think this won't be of any 
use, but maybe this can help you get even closer! At the same time, it's still 
good to make new friends. If we hang out solely with one group of people, over 
time groupthink develops and thought patterns converge. This is good in reducing 
social friction, but it means we become stagnant. New friends can provide 
different perspectives and challenge our beliefs.

Developing and deepening friendships is a life long process and we can always 
get better at it. So without further ado, here's my guide to friendshipping. 
When trying to make new friends, start at step 1. With old friends you want to 
get closer to, you may be at step 2 or 3.

##1. Get in the right mindset##

Some days you might not like yourself. Some days you can't deal with other 
people. That's all okay, it happens to the best of us. But on those days it's 
probably not ideal for you to be making friends. Ideal conditions are when 
you're feeling positive and talkative.

Generally, people like positive energy. It's infectious and it makes them feel 
better. Friends may put up with negativity, but why would someone you just met 
want to deal with that if they don't have to? Maybe you can make it work 
regardless, but I find that when I'm feeling positive, it's even easier on 
myself to try to meet people.

If positivity is not your thing, at the bare minimum it's necessary to get in a 
mood to talk. A core component in meeting someone is the conversation you share. 
That conversation could potentially lead into a friendship, so be mindful to 
actively partake.

This step is where Nav and I went wrong. We met at a networking event where I 
had already been drained from all the socializing, so when we spoke, I was not 
in the proper state and it was hard for us to hit it off.

##2. Build rapport##

Surprisingly, not everyone shares the exact same interests as me. Conversation 
doesn't work out when one person talks about something of interest to them, but 
the other person doesn't care. When there's no reciprocated caring, that's where 
the "small talk and how is your weekend crap" occurs.

One way to solve this is to find common interests we can both talk about and 
care about. But if we can't find one, another way is to try to care about their 
interests. If I don't know anything about the subject, it's a good chance to 
learn something new about it! Making an effort to listen and learn goes a long 
way.

If you can't find a common interest, and even when you try to probe and learn 
more about theirs you find it's not working out, then maybe it just doesn't work 
out. Sometimes you can't seem to find that mutual attraction no matter what. 
Maybe that means the other party didn't achieve step 1, or they're just not 
interested in you. That happens. It sucks, but don't let it stop you from trying 
to connect with other people!

##3. Open up##

As I originally hypothesized, I still think this is the most important step. 
Common interests create conversation, but trust is what creates meaningful 
friendships. Building trust involves sharing things about yourself beyond just 
your interests - your feelings, personal matters in your life, etc.

Sharing your feelings is not a sign of weakness. I'd even dare say it's a sign 
of strength. It means you're not afraid of putting yourself out there. Even 
though there's always the chance that you could get hurt, you're willing to take 
that risk to connect emotionally with others.

Yes, sometimes if you open up to the wrong people, it'll come back to bite you, 
but if you've managed to build rapport and they don't seem to be of shady 
character, then more often than not, trusting is not a bad thing.

##4. Profit!##

If you've followed the 3 steps, you should have now made a new best friend. 
Congratulations! Joking aside, I do hope these steps help you to build more 
meaningful friendships. Let me know if the steps work or don't work for you, as 
well as if you think I'm missing something crucial in the process.
