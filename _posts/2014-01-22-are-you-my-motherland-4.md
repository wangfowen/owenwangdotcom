The title should sufficiently explain it, but I'll elaborate for those with 
beyond tweet-length attention spans. I had a post on Barcelona and half written 
ones on Berlin and Budapest done when I lost the heart to continue the series. 
I'll summarize the three below:

Barcelona
Flashing green but people go pretty much as soon as it turns red.
Funny muscular green lights
Open late, stop selling drinks early, start late. Takes a bit of getting used to
Barcelona has the hikes and the beaches
Metro counts down seconds. Super accurate
Never seen as much PDA anywhere else.
Flies. Only place been to in Europe actually found bugs to be at an annoying 
scale
Very attractive guys, not as many for girls

Berlin
Food is absolutely fantastic, both the local cuisine and international kinds. 
Particularly the doners and the beer.
German efficiency is no joke.
The history is incredibly rich, even someone like me who hates history can learn 
about it for weeks.
One of the best club scenes.  Prices are reasonable

Budapest
Cheapest place I've been. Big Mac combo is 1290ft (about $5).
Felt like Rome with its gorgeous architecture, but much more colorful and less 
crowded. You actually have room to breathe and take photos. 

The reason I lost heart is because I came to see how baseless the idea behind it 
is. Each city I've visited for roughly three days. In three days usually one day 
is spent walking around taking enough landscapes for a photographer to climax, 
one day is doing tours to learn history (tip-based walking tours are generally 
the best quality), and one is doing whatever else tourist attractions there are. 

The extent of what I did to stray off the typical tourist track is seek out hole 
in wall restaurants (link to lean traveling), avoid touristy museums, and go out 
of my way to talk to other travelers / locals. That makes me more of a hipster 
tourist than a traveler. 

So really I just caressed the faces of the cities. I can't righteously declare a 
place livable after 3 days. Just like how I wouldn't marry a girl after just 3 
dates. Sorry Britney Spears. 

I've been in lyon for over 4 months and only recently did I begin to truly 
notice and appreciate the more subtle cultural differences that made it unique. 
I may do a post on lyon since that's actually justified. the short answer is 
probably no. but at least I know that for the city itself, and not for the 
tourist facade of it.

So goodbye AYMM. It's been a fun series to write and I will still be on the 
lookout for the small quirky differences when I'm in a city, but I no longer 
dare judge them by their first chapter (although if we are going to use the book 
analogy, I can't think of any I've enjoyed if I didn't like the beginning...)
