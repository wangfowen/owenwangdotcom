I'm a sucker for catchy mottoes: "Work Hard, Play Hard", "Go Big or Go 
Home", "YOLO". If you're going to have a guiding life principle, why not let 
it roll off the tongue?

Along the same lines, I've begun to live by a mantra of my own: "Path of Least 
Regret". I know, it doesn't quite have the same ring to it, but what it means 
is this: when you're at a crossroad debating which choice to make, __choose the 
one you'll regret the least in the future, even if it goes bad__.  The one that 
would result in fewer "what if"s and "if only"s.  Where when you look back, 
you'll think yes, I'm glad I chose that.

Thinking under that mindset has not only helped me make some hard decisions, but 
it has also allowed me to experience things I wouldn't have otherwise.

A silly example is when I tried salsa classes while studying abroad. Right away 
the language barrier and my poor coordination got the best of me. I stumbled in 
leading and getting the steps right. Every time we rotated, I could see my new 
partner masking a look of annoyance at having to dance with me.

The class severely bruised my ego. It took everything within me to not quit. 
What got me through it was remembering why I took it in the first place. I've 
wanted to learn salsa for the longest time. In part, to impress ladies back 
home. Sure, currently people were annoyed with me, but I wasn't doing it for 
them. I was doing it to invest in my future self. If I didn't learn salsa now 
just because it was hard, wouldn't future-me be mad at present-me? _Wouldn't I 
regret that decision?_ The opportunity to learn from authentic Spanish dancers 
doesn't come every day. Besides, I wouldn't see these people again after a 
couple short months, so did it even actually matter if they despised my dancing?

With that mentality, I stopped myself from quitting every time I thought about 
it. I kept going with the class and as I got better, the contempt my partners 
held for me dissipated. My ego recovered and I had learned the basics of 
something I'd wanted. Everyone lived happily ever after.

Often we forgo experiences because of the initial discomfort â€” that bashing of 
our confidence from not knowing what we're doing. There will certainly be 
uneasiness to start as we struggle through the unknown. Sucking, as the name 
implies, sucks.

In contrast, we could just continue old habits and not break the mold. Avoid all 
the pain by doing what's easier and familiar. But if you think about 
future-you's desires, wouldn't he or she want to have learned that new skill? To 
have tried that thing they hadn't before? Would future-you think "if only I 
didn't try that", or is it more likely they'd think "if only I did".

Unfortunately, just _wanting_ something enough doesn't make it happen. 
Present-you has to _take action_ towards that, even if it's unpleasant at the 
beginning. So next time you're considering your options, I say __screw the path 
of least resistance. Take the path of least regret.__
