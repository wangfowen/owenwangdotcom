I'm a sucker for catchy mottoes: "Work Hard, Play Hard", "Go Big or Go 
Home", "YOLO". If you're going to have a guiding life principle, why not let 
it roll off the tongue?

Along the same lines, I've begun to live by a mantra of my own: "Path of Least 
Regret". I know, it doesn't quite have the same ring to it, but what it means 
is this: when you're at a crossroad debating which choice to make, __choose the 
one future-you will regret the least, even if it goes bad__. The one that would 
result in fewer "what if"s and "if only"s. Where when you look back, you'll 
think yes, I'm glad I chose that.

Thinking under that mindset has not only helped me make some hard decisions, but 
it has also allowed me to experience things I wouldn't have otherwise.

A silly example is when I tried salsa classes while studying abroad. Right away 
the language barrier and my poor coordination got the best of me. I stumbled in 
leading and getting the steps right. Every time we rotated partners, I could see 
my new one masking a look of annoyance at having to dance with me again.

The class severely bruised my ego. It took everything within me to not quit. 
What got me through it was remembering why I took it in the first place. I've 
wanted to learn salsa for the longest time. In part, to impress ladies back 
home. Why did it matter that currently people were annoyed with me? I wasn't 
doing it for them, I was doing it to invest in my future self. Besides, I 
wouldn't see these people again after a couple short months. If I didn't learn 
salsa just because it was hard, wouldn't future-me be mad at present-me? The 
opportunity to learn from authentic Spanish dancers doesn't come every day.

With that mentality, I stopped myself from quitting every time I thought about 
it. I kept going with the class and as I got better, the contempt my partners 
held for me dissipated. My ego recovered and I had learned the basics of 
something I'd wanted. Everyone lived happily ever after.

Often we forgo experiences because of the initial discomfort, like what I felt 
in salsa. That bashing our ego feels from not knowing what we're doing. There 
will certainly be uneasiness to start as we suck and struggle through the 
learning curve and the unknown. Sucking as the name implies sucks.

In contrast, we could just settle into a routine and not break the mold. Avoid 
all the pain. But if you think about future-you's desires, wouldn't he or she 
have wanted to have learned that new skill? To have tried that thing they hadn't 
before? Would future-you have thought "if only I didn't try that", or is it more 
likely they'd think "if only I did".

Unfortunately, _wanting_ something enough doesn't make it happen. Present-you 
has to _take action_ towards that, even if it's unpleasant at the beginning. So 
next time you're considering your options, I say screw the path of least 
resistance. __Take the path of least regret.__
