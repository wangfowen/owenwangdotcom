As another year draws to a close, my time spent reflecting spikes once again. No 
words can describe how incredible 2013 has been; so many adventures with friends 
old and new. This is by far the year in which I've grown the most in every sense 
of the word as well as the one I've felt the happiest overall. I don't doubt the 
growth and happiness are connected, but that's a topic for a future post.

In this I'd simply like to take a moment to think back on all the good times I 
had this year with you wonderful people, in the form of a collage. I've included 
some keywords with each memory to help lubricate the nostalgia. Not all keywords 
for a picture apply to everyone. Don't panic if it doesn't mean anything to you. 

Some of what I've enjoyed the most from events are the conversations. It didn't 
feel right to include those in the blurbs, so I leave those up to you to 
reminisce about.

<div id="overlay">
  <div id="gallery"></div>

  <div id="close">Ã—</div>
  <div class="arrow" id="left"><</div>
  <div class="arrow" id="right">></div>
</div>

They say every year is supposed to be better than the next. I don't know who 
this "they" actually is, but 2013 feels like it will be hard to top. I truly 
want to thank each and every one of you who has been part of the ride. I am so 
grateful to have had all of your presence in my life. If you're reading this and 
I don't know you yet, let's change that in the coming year!  I'm very much 
looking forward to all that's in store for 2014.
