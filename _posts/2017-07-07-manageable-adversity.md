I don't think myself to be particularly ambitious &mdash; I don't share the rest 
of Silicon Valley's desire to create unicorns, disrupt other industries, or eat 
the world with software. All I want out of my work is for it to be directionally 
correct in bettering the world. As I'm soon to be job hunting again, I wanted to 
form some structure around what exactly that means to me.

Part of why I'm writing this is also to make a request from you, dear reader. I've boxed the problem space in my mind somewhat, but it's still plagued with vaguery. My thoughts come from very limited readings, conversations with friends, and what's been brooding in my head. I'd love to hear the thoughts of others that are better educated on the subject(s). Or if you have recommendations for related readings or tech job openings, please let me know!

## Others' Adversity

I hate seeing my friends in pain. Ideally I'd be able to end any and all suffering they ever face, and to a lesser extent the same for the rest of the world that I don't personally know. 

At the same time, I believe that dealing with hardships enriches our lives and brings us meaning. Overcoming adversity helps us grow and mature, and allows us to relate and connect better with others that've faced similar trials. Overcoming adversity has also been shown to help us build resilience (while resilience also helps us better overcome adversity…), and resilience has been strongly correlated with happiness.

Also, I'm not a domain expert on most problems I haven't faced myself, so in many cases my help in easing others' pain isn't even warranted or wanted. So how do I reconcile my desire to help others end their struggles vs letting them painfully struggle through on their own? What types of problems should I be trying to help resolve, if any at all? Should I be trying to become a domain expert or how do I go about helping correctly?

## Survival-Jeopardizing Adversity

A precursor to what problems should I personally help resolve is what problems do I think should be resolved in the world in general. Not all adversity are created equal. Living in a war-torn country clearly does not have the same consequences as going through a breakup.

One scene from Pursuit of Happyness struck a chord with me on this subject. Will Smith was forced to sleep in a public bathroom with his son for a night because an unfortunate setback caused him to be unable to afford rent, and they couldn't get a spot in the homeless shelter that night. Seriously A+ acting on his part, the shame and tears in his eyes at having had to resort to that felt so real, the fear of not being able to provide for his son.

Another similarly poignant moment was from the show Atlanta. Donald Glover's character Earn was looking to make some quick cash from a pawn shop, and his friend Darius told him he could make him more than what the store offered. After a string of events, it turned out Darius got him a dog that'd be worth $4000 after it fully grows, months later, to which Earn responded:

> Van needed that money. My daughter needed that money. Not in September, but 
> today. See, I'm poor, Darius. And poor people don't have time for investments 
> because poor people are too busy trying not to be poor. I need to eat today, 
> not in September.

While I can't relate to either of these events having not experienced anything like them myself, I was left with an unsettled feeling thinking about how when we can't meet our basic survival needs, it's hard to think beyond the present and consider other aspects of life, like investing in the future, which I take for granted as a given to be doing.

I'm a strong believer of mindset being able to change our lives. If we reframe our problems, change how we think about and approach them, we can overcome so much. I've read of people changing their outlook and finding meaning in the worst of pains like the death of a loved one.

However, for such survival jeopardizing adversity, changing how we look at the problem is not enough. We are at the whim of outside circumstances. ELABORATE? We lack control and choices, and therefore overcoming the adversity may likely be impossible. Adversity like this brings suffering with less room for growth, and that to me is adversity that should be eliminated. 

From talking to friends from lower income families, I came to see that tips espoused by self-help gurus to change your mindset like “be positive” or “embrace risks” not only aren't enough to resolve the issues, but even when attempted are harder to apply than it would be for me.

If so much of your previous experience has pointed at outcomes turning out negatively, you'd be delusional to bank on positivity changing things. If one mistake would bring your whole livelihood crashing down, how can you be confident that things will get better? If so much of your well being is outside of your control, how can you feel like anything is possible?

## Manageable Adversity

I'm in a position where luckily I've had a support network around me for the problems I've faced. They've provided insights that I might not have arrived at alone, and given me the room to grow and take risks without fear of my whole life crashing down. Changing our thought patterns is a risk, and in general is quite hard to do. Only through repeated trial and error are we able to eventually make it happen. Having support has made my adversity more manageable.

Since the adversity I face doesn't pin me to the present and it's made manageable by my safety net, I'm able to grow through them. I'm able to take the time and space to ponder about my problems, to do things like take months off to travel. Even the fact that I have mental space to think about others' problems is because everything else in my life is secure enough.

This support network is provided by my friends and family. But such a network doesn't exist for everyone. When people feel isolated, studies show resilience decreases. My belief is society should provide that safety net to those that don't have it.

## Providing Support

I want to end the survival jeopardizing adversity in the world, and to help more of people's adversity, especially those of my friends, become manageable adversity. In both cases, I think my role would be to provide support, to empower and enable others to be able to solve these problems themselves. What support means is completely different from one problem to another — for systemic issues, it'd be a community, for heartbreak it'd be someone to talk to.

I don't fully understand what it takes to end survival jeopardizing adversity, nor am I in a position to solve or eliminate them. What I can do is help elevate the voices of those with solutions, and create communities for people to come together to solve the problems. There's a lot of research that shows community helps people build resilience.

Also I can try to help create a society-wide safety net to make the problems more manageable. What I think it takes to do that is:


- Improve the state of mental health support available
- Make healthcare universal so that if someone is sick, it doesn't ruin their life. 46% of Americans are unable to pay an emergency bill of $400.
- Improve access to education so that if everything else is stable, and they make an effort, they can gain the skills to open up new opportunities.
- Provide shelters for people so they can not worry about survival.
- Provide platforms to fund and create opportunities for people to get started in making a living
- Improve access to education for people to learn new skills for work

And for all other adversity, if I don't have the expertise to provide the safety net for them, connecting people to resources and communities, helping to provide the specific safety net for them would also be helpful.

## Specific Solutions

Most things that help one faction come at the expense of another. Safety nets funded by society come from someone's pocket and at the cost of another cause someone else is interested in. Ideally we'd be able to arrive at win-win solutions, but I don't have any specific ideas myself. That's where my initial request from you comes in.

Would what I have in mind to provide a safety net be what'd help? What else can be done? What is already being done? Do any of these places have software job openings?

If I were to think in a Theory of Change way, tech probably isn't even the right way to make these changes happen, so if I truly wanted to make the most impact on these, I'd consider changing professions. But currently I still believe tech can help in building tools towards these issues, and I'm not yet willing to completely let go of all the comfort and privileges a tech job allows me.
