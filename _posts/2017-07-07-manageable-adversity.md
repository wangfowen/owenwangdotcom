I don't think myself to be particularly ambitious &mdash; I don't share the rest 
of Silicon Valley's desire to create unicorns, disrupt other industries, or eat 
the world with software. All I want out of my work is to build tools that better 
the world somehow. As I'm soon to be job hunting again, I wanted to sort through 
my thoughts on what exactly that means to me; to form some structure around what 
I want to change in our current society.

Part of why I'm writing this is also to make a request from you, dear reader. 
I've boxed the problem space in my mind somewhat, but as you'll see it's still 
plagued with vaguery. My thoughts are formed from very limited readings, 
conversations with friends, and what's been brooding in my own head. I'd love to 
hear solutions from others that are better educated on the subject(s). Or if you 
have recommendations for related readings or tech job openings, please let me 
know!

##The Role of Adversity

I've been thinking a lot recently about the various kinds of hardships people 
face in their lives. I believe that dealing with hardships make our lives more 
interesting and meaningful. They help us develop uniquely, while at the same 
time help us relate and connect to others that've faced similar trials.

Overcoming adversity has also been shown to help us build resilience (while 
resilience also helps us better overcome adversity...), and resilience has been 
strongly correlated with happiness.

If we shouldn't actually eliminate all pains that people would face, what kinds 
should we try to as a society? Some things are clearly unnecessary for people to 
be facing &mdash; living in a war-torn country does not have the same 
consequences as going through a breakup.

And for everyone else, to what extent should we help / how do we help with their 
pains? A lot of it does come down to the individual themselves taking control of 
the situation and growing in a way to overcome it, but for those that cannot, 
what can we do to help?

##Survival-Jeopardizing Adversity

I was watching Pursuit of Happyness a while back, and one scene particularly 
stood out to me. Will Smith was forced to sleep in a public bathroom with his 
son for a night because an unfortunate setback caused him to be unable to afford 
rent, and they couldn't get a spot in the homeless shelter that night. Seriously 
A+ acting on his part, the shame and tears in his eyes at having had to resort 
to that felt so real, the fear of not being able to provide for his son.

Another similarly poignant moment was from the show Atlanta. Donald Glover's 
character Earn was looking to make some quick cash from a pawn shop, and his 
friend Darius told him he could make him more than what the store offered. In 
the end it turned out Darius invested that money in something that'd be worth 
$4000 down the line, to which Earn responded:

> Van needed that money. My daughter needed that money. Not in September, but 
> today. See, I'm poor, Darius. And poor people don't have time for investments 
> because poor people are too busy trying not to be poor. I need to eat today, 
> not in September.

While I can't relate to either of these events having not experienced anything 
like them myself, I was left with an unsettled feeling thinking about how when 
we can't meet our basic survival needs, it's hard to consider other aspects of 
life, like investing in the future, which I take for granted as a given to be 
doing.

Adversity like that permeates all aspects of life, making everything else 
harder. From talking to some friends from lower income families, I came to see 
that tips espoused by self-help gurus like "be positive" or "embrace risks" 
don't make much sense when you're in that kind of a state, making it harder to 
get back up when you're down.

If so much of your previous experience has pointed at outcomes turning out 
negatively, you'd be delusional to bank on positivity changing things. If one 
mistake would bring your whole livelihood crashing down, how can you be 
confident that things will get better? If so much of your well being is outside 
of your control, how can you feel like anything is possible?

There's research that shows making less than $75,000 a year correlates with 
reduced happiness, while above that does not change much. The way I see that now 
is adversity related to survival is constantly on the mind, and takes away 
enjoyment from everything else.

I've categorized this kind of adversity as survival-jeopardizing, and I put 
living in war-torn countries and dealing with life-threatening illnesses in the 
same bucket, and this I think is a level of hardships people shouldn't have to 
deal with.

##Manageable Adversity

For everyone else, even if we don't eliminate their problems, I think the extent 
that we can help is through providing support. When people feel isolated and 
like they don't have control over their life, studies show resilience decreases.

I'm in a position where luckily I've had a support network around me for the 
problems I've faced, and it's allowed me to grow and take risks.

I'm able to take half a year off from working to travel because I don't have 
anyone depending on me for survival, and I'm confident I can still get a job 
when I'm back. Or even if I can't, I won't die because I have a home I can stay 
at until I figure things out again. Even the fact that I have mental space in 
thinking about inequality is because everything else in my life is secure 
enough.

And everything is secure enough because I have a safety net, provided by my 
friends and family. But that safety net doesn't exist for everyone. For some, if 
they fall, that's it, it's hard to recover. So they can't take the opportunities 
even when they're right in front of them. My belief is society should provide 
that safety net for everyone, since not everyone has the family to provide it.

With support, adversity becomes much more manageable. What support means is 
completely different from one problem to another &mdash; for systemic issues, 
it'd be a community, for heartbreak it'd be someone to talk to.

##Required Changes

How do we eliminate survival jeopardizing adversity? I don't fully understand 
these problems, nor am I in a position to solve or eliminate them. But what 
software can help do is provide platforms for communities to help them solve 
their own problems better. To elevate their voices and allow them to combine 
their efforts across the globe. There's a lot of research that shows community 
helps people build resilience and help them feel less isolated.

And also I think society can help provide a safety net to help make these issues 
more manageable. To that we need to:

- Improve the state of mental health help available
- Improve the state of health care so that if someone is sick, it doesn't ruin 
  their life. 46% of Americans are unable to pay an emergency bill of $400.
- Improve access to education so that if everything else is stable, and they 
  make an effort, they can gain the skills to open up new opportunities.
- Provide shelters for people so they can not worry about survival. 
- Provide platforms to fund and create opportunities for people to get started 
  in making a living
- Improve access to education for people to learn new skills for work

Or maybe just universal basic income would suffice in this front. We worry about 
such a thing being squandered on some, where they just blow it on drugs. Well, 
if they do, so be it. At least the opportunity to do otherwise was provided to
them.

For everyone else, support networks through platforms would also be helpful.

##Specific Solutions

Most things that help one faction come at the expense of another. Safety nets 
funded by society come from someone's pocket and at the cost of another cause 
someone else is interested in. Ideally we'd be able to arrive at win-win 
solutions, but I don't have any specific ideas myself. That's where my initial 
request from you comes in!

If I were to think in a Theory of Change way, tech probably isn't even the right 
way to make these changes happen, so if I truly wanted to make the most impact 
on these, I'd consider changing professions. But currently I still believe tech 
can help in building tools towards these issues, and I'm not yet willing to 
completely let go of all the comfort and privileges a tech job allows me.

I don't expect myself to work on or change all of them. I just want to work on 
something that is directionally correct. Even though the world will never be 
completely fair, I'd like to hope we can make it as fair as possible within 
society's control.
