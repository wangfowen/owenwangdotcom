I previously talked about [how engineering shaped the way I 
thought](/blog/engineers-mindset-for-life). I left one out for later &mdash; 
methodical searching &mdash; and that later is now

Search is a whole subsector of computer science. It's at the base of many of the 
tools we use - Google to find the information you care about through all of the 
internet, Amazon to find the thing you want to buy within their massive 
warehouses, Tinder to find a soul mate in the vast expanse of the dating space 
near you. Depending on the problem space, you'll want to search differently, but 
however it's done, it's done according to an algorithm, according to a 
structured methodology.

Squiggly path of unstructured searching. Structured searching gives me a way of 
thinking about approaching any sort of task. When I do something mundane, I'm 
thinking about how can I improve the process to get to a better state, 
methodically eliminating options that don't make sense.  But I think the biggest 
way that searching has affected how I think about things is the way it's got me 
thinking about what I do in life overall.  In searching, you have one parameter 
to optimize. In real life you're optimizing several different things.  Improving 
one may decrease another. Maybe to become happier you have to change jobs which 
decreases finances. Becomes a complex problem to balance all the different 
things you want.  For the sake of simplicity I'll just talk about one facet. For 
me that happens to be satisfaction.

This could be the subject of a whole other post, but for background, I define 
life satisfaction as a mix of happiness and 
[meaning](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/01/theres-more-to-life-than-being-happy/266805/). 
Happiness is transient and fluctuating, but satisfaction is the enduring 
baseline. This is clearly not a rigorous definition, nor do I scientifically 
quantify it. It's a hand wavy measurement based on how I feel relative to prior 
satisfaction levels.

Life doesn't quite work like simulated annealing since you can't do several 
different runs of life. However, the graph is endless and there are many optimas 
you can go to, and it's possible to try to return to a similar optima. And you 
don't know what the ultimate optima is, but you can try to get to a higher one 
than where you're currently at.

Becoming complacent is when you hit a local optima and no longer do anything 
different that can improve things. Your happiness will likely fade when you're 
stagnant because of hedonic adaptation (link to prior post), and depending on 
where you go from there, you may slowly spiral down, or if you find a different 
mindset (acceptance), you can stay pretty consistently in that local optima.

However, it is unlikely you'll go much higher from there. If you want to 
increase the baseline, some form of change has to occur. 

As we see in simulated annealing, if you think you're already pretty optimal, it 
wouldn't make any sense to do anything too drastic. You'd want to make small, 
intentional changes. Maybe try a new experience or meet some new people, perhaps 
something like Learning Night.  It may feel scary to do this because it takes 
inertia and initial discomfort to get out of our comfort zones, but you wouldn't 
get yields otherwise -> small changes in the curve could find a bigger jump.
It's also important to note that it's impossible to tell what will be on the 
other side of that hill. If you go into it expecting for satisfaction to 
increase, or solely with the goal of increasing satisfaction, that's not going 
to work out well. Make the change because it's something that has interested 
you. Because why not? Maybe it'll take you climbing hundreds of these hills 
before you find the big kahuna. 

Now, sometimes life throws curveballs at you. Even if you don't want any change, 
sometimes it's out of your control. Perhaps a death or a breakup. Negative 
events may bring us down way low, but we don't have to remain there. From 
simulated annealing, we know that when we're at a low point, we're more willing 
to take bigger risks. Maybe we reevaluate and overhaul all the things we've done 
wrong or we find some sort of meaning that puts our lives on a different path -> 
giant dip, followed by giant jump.
