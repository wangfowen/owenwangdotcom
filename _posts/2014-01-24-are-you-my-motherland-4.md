_In this [series](/blog/are-you-my-motherland) I examine some cities I've 
visited and what I've experienced to be different about them in the hopes of 
finding pride in my old homes or discovering a new place to call home._

Discontinued is unfortunately not the name of some obscure city. It's exactly 
what you'd think it means; I'm abandoning this series. To elaborate, I had a 
post on Barcelona and half-written ones on Berlin and Budapest done when I lost 
the desire to continue. I'll summarize the three below:

## Barcelona

- Drivers are extremely aggressive. As soon as the light turns red, you best be 
off the street
- The metro counts down arrival time by the second. Can't get more accurate than 
that
- Everything is open late. This is because things also happen late -- people eat 
dinner around 9pm, then go out around 2am
- The city has hikes as well as beaches. I didn't realize how much I enjoyed 
having both in one city until Barcelona
- Great mix of crazy art, history, architecture, and clubs
- The only time I've seen more public displays of affection than Barcelona on a 
regular day was the Eiffel Tower on New Year's Eve. Lots of love going around in 
Spain
- Flies everywhere. Only place so far in Europe where bugs got annoying

## Berlin

- Food is absolutely fantastic, both the local cuisine and international.  
Particularly the doner kebabs and the beer
- German efficiency is no joke. _Everything_ ran exactly on time
- The history is incredibly rich. Even someone like me with little interest in 
history can learn about it for weeks here
- One of the best club scenes I've experienced
- Prices are very reasonable

## Budapest

- Cheapest place I've been by far. If we judge by the Big Mac index, a combo was 
1290ft (about $5)
- The architecture was almost Rome-caliber yet also very colorful
- Much less crowded than other tourist destinations. You actually have room to 
breathe!

The reason I lost heart was because I came to see how baseless the idea behind 
the series was. Each city that I reviewed, I visited for roughly three days. In 
that time span, usually one day was spent doing tours to learn about the city 
(tip-based walking tours are the best quality), one day was spent on whatever 
else tourist attractions there were, and one day was spent strolling through the 
  city, taking pictures. By the end I had enough landscapes for any photographer 
  to climax.

Looking at that, I just _toured_ the cities. I didn't actually _travel_ or 
_live_ them. The extent of what I did to stray off the typical tourist track was 
[seek out hole-in-wall restaurants](/blog/lean-traveling), avoid touristy 
museums, and go out of my way to talk to other travelers / locals. That makes me 
more of a hipster tourist than a traveler. I can't righteously declare a place 
livable after 3 days. Just like how I wouldn't marry a girl after just 3 dates. 
Sorry Britney Spears.

I've been in Lyon for over 4 months and only recently did I begin to truly 
notice and appreciate the more subtle cultural differences that made it unique. 
I may do a post on Lyon since that's actually justified. The short answer is no, 
I probably wouldn't live there, but at least I know that for the city itself, 
and not for the tourist facade of it.

So goodbye "Are You My Motherland". It's been a fun series to write and I will 
still be on the lookout for the quirks when I'm in a city, but I no longer dare 
claim to know a city after so short a time.
