The title should sufficiently explain it, but I'll elaborate for those who want 
more than a tweet. I had a post on Barcelona and half-written ones on Berlin and 
Budapest done when I lost the desire to continue the series. I'll summarize the 
three below:

##Barcelona##

- Drivers are extremely aggressive. As soon as the light turns red, you best be 
off the street
- The metro counts down arrival time by the second. Can't get more accurate than 
that
- Everything is open late. This is because things also happen late -- people eat 
dinner around 9pm, then go out around 2am
- The city has hikes as well as beaches. I didn't realize how much I enjoyed 
having both in one city until Barcelona
- Great mix of crazy art, history, architecture, and clubs
- The only time I've seen more public displays of affection than Barcelona on a 
regular day was the Eiffel Tower on New Year's Eve. Lots of love going around in 
Spain
- Flies everywhere. Only place so far in Europe where bugs got annoying
- I heard great things about Barcelona from everyone before going so I tried my 
best to critique and hate it, but it really is fantastic

##Berlin##

- Food is absolutely fantastic, both the local cuisine and international. 
Particularly the doners and the beer
- German efficiency is no joke
- The history is incredibly rich. Even someone like me with little interest in 
history can learn about it for weeks here
- One of the best club scenes I've experienced
- Prices are very reasonable

##Budapest##

- Cheapest place I've been by far. If we judge by the Big Mac index, a combo was 
1290ft (about $5)
- The architecture was almost Rome-caliber yet also very colorful
- Much less crowded than other tourist destinations. You actually have room to 
breathe

The reason I lost heart is because I came to see how baseless the idea behind 
the series is. Each city I've visited for roughly three days. In that time span 
usually one day is spent doing tours to learn about the city (tip-based walking 
tours are the best quality), one day is spent on whatever else tourist 
attractions there are, and one day is spent walking around taking pictures. By 
the end I have enough landscapes for a photographer to climax.

Looking at that, I just toured the cities. I didn't actually travel or live 
them. The extent of what I did to stray off the typical tourist track is [seek 
out hole-in-wall restaurants]({% post_url 2014-01-21-lean-traveling %}), avoid 
touristy museums, and go out of my way to talk to other travelers / locals. That 
makes me more of a hipster tourist than a traveler.

So really I just caressed the faces of the cities. I can't righteously declare a 
place livable after 3 days. Just like how I wouldn't marry a girl after just 3 
dates. Sorry Britney Spears.

I've been in Lyon for over 4 months and only recently did I begin to truly 
notice and appreciate the more subtle cultural differences that made it unique. 
I may do a post on Lyon since that's actually justified. The short answer is 
probably no, but at least I know that for the city itself, and not for the 
tourist facade of it.

So goodbye "Are You My Motherland". It's been a fun series to write and I will 
still be on the lookout for the small quirky differences when I'm in a city, but 
I no longer dare judge them by their first chapter (although if we are going to 
use the book analogy, I can't think of any I've enjoyed if I didn't like the 
beginning...)
