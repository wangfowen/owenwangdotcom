Every ending is a new beginning
Helped me get over moving to new places since we have to do it so often. Very used to adapting to new situations and making new friends wherever we are.
I still miss my friends back home from time to time, but I've gotten much more used to enjoying present company.
Moving every four months means we can't be materialistic
