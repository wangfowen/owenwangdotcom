A product manager friend once told me that in his line of work he thinks a lot 
about funnels &mdash; that's usually how growth is modeled &mdash; and he'd 
begun looking at other aspects of life through a similar lens.

I've been working full time as an engineer for almost a year now, and it's 
gotten me wondering how that's shaped my own views. If product managers think in 
funnels, what do engineers think in terms of?

I've narrowed my own thought patterns down to three major concepts: 
optimizations, failure modes, and methodical searching. In this post I'll just 
talk about the first two, as the third is a whole beast of its own.

###Optimizations###

There is never a silver bullet that solves every possible problem. Instead you 
have to choose which problems are the most pressing and optimize for solving 
just those, while neglecting (or less optimally solving) the others.

If you want your algorithm to run faster, usually you'll need to use more 
memory. If you want to decrease data loss, you'll need to store multiple copies 
of the same data, which increases complexity as well as storage costs. It's 
important to keep in mind that it's almost always impossible to optimize for 
everything; something has to give.

Outside of work, time management is a huge problem for me. I don't have enough 
waking hours for everything I want to do, so I have to evaluate what I want 
most. If I want to meet more new people, then I have less time to spend with my 
existing friends. Or if I spend large portions of time on both, then I have less 
time for self improvement.

There are some micro-optimizations I could do, like doing self improvement 
activities with friends. But in the end, it's still not possible to achieve it 
all. So which of these desires do I care the most about?

To optimize, when I come to a crossroad for how to spend my time, I try to 
quantify as best as I can exactly what I'd give up and what I'd gain in doing 
each activity. When I weigh my options and remind myself that there's not a 
perfect solution, it makes it much easier to come to terms with my decision.

###Failure Modes###

Whenever we're designing a system, we have to consider what could be potential 
bottlenecks and points of failure down the line. And if a failure does occur, 
how would the system react?

Imagine a social media site stored every users content on a separate computer. 
If a user's post when viral, then that one computer would likely get overwhelmed 
and crash. What if we stored several copies of the same post across different 
computers in the same location? What could fail then, and when? Maybe during a 
power outage?

It's crucial to poke holes in the system and preemptively think about potential 
problems and how to handle them, so that when something does go awry, the 
consequences are manageable.

Looking at life, I often think to myself: realistically what are all the ways 
this could go wrong? Thinking like this allows me to address issues before they 
occur, and has helped me rationalize and overcome many of my fears.

When I was at a stage in my life where I had anxiety in talking to new people, 
part of what helped me overcome it was thinking about the failure cases and 
realizing how inconsequential they actually were. The other person isn't 
interested in talking, so they politely decline to partake? You at least gave it 
a shot, no feelings were hurt, and you move on with your life without regrets. 
They say something mean, or they flat out ignore you? You feel briefly 
humiliated, but within moments neither of you will think about each other again 
and your lives move on.  Is that really so bad?

Overall, this mindset has helped me justify some risks, and convinced me to not 
take certain other ones. But always considering failure modes can have its own 
failure modes! If a friend tells me about their upcoming plans, my first 
reaction is to try and find gaps in it, to help them think through all the 
scenarios. This sometimes appears as if I'm unsupportive and pessimistic, and 
may not have been what they were looking for. I'm still working on figuring out 
when to turn this off!

###What About You?#

I'm sure none of the mindsets I've described above are unique to engineering. I 
suspect many careers would mold us in similar ways, but the vocabulary for 
talking about the mindsets may be different.

I'm intrigued to find out what commonalities there are among different 
disciplines' ways of thinking, and I'm especially curious about what may be 
radically different.

So how do you think _your_ profession has changed how _you_ think? I'd love to 
hear your responses!
