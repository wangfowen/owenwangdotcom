_In this [on-going series]({% post_url 2013-10-12-are-you-my-motherland %}) I 
examine some cities I've visited and what I've experienced to be different about 
them in the hopes of finding pride in my old homes or discovering a new place to 
call home._

Copenhagen. Our next stop after Italy. I only wanted to check it out because my 
friend Anna was studying abroad here. I knew next to nothing about Copenhagen 
and hadn't heard any talk of it, so I figured we'd just do a brief stop on the 
way to the ultimate travel destination: Amsterdam. Only prior to departure did 
we google to find out they have an entirely different currency and language...

## Airport ##

Prettiest airport ever. Could hardly tell it was an airport. The floor was 
immaculate. Perfectly timed baggage claim.

## Architecture ##

Old pretty buildings and canals, yet also good amount of technology.
You can tell they care about accessibility and the environment. There are many 
advertisements for electric cars and as we flew in we saw a wind farm.

## Signs ##

Every block has its own street name. Most are just proper nouns instead of 
something street, etc.
Funny stop light.

## Food ##

Food is uber expensive, so we never actually ate at a proper sit down 
restaurant. Even a breakfast sandwich was equivalent to roughly 8 euros. 
Therefore I'm not sure if you actually tip or not at restaurants.  Apparently 
housing is also expensive and hard to find.

Food is very diverse. There were more offerings than just Danish food. What 
exactly is Danish food? Chocolate danishes apparently aren't it. As blasphemous 
as it was, we got Asian food during one of our days there. At first I felt a 
hint of guilt for eating Asian food in Europe, but as soon as the pad thai made 
contact with my tongue, all guilt went out the window. The surge of pleasure 
from the greasy, delicious noodles satisfied needs I didn't even know I had. It 
seems if I want to live in a city, there needs to be good Asian food.

## Public Transportation ##

Train has 30 second precision on timing. They're fast, sleek, quiet. Some buses 
have wifi on them. And definitely the best part: bike lanes were either raised, 
separated by mediums, or separated by parked cars. One way or another, this 
place was extremely friendly to bikers. I read somewhere afterwards over 50% of 
the city commutes via bike. How amazing is that? So environmentally friendly and 
healthy. In general the city seemed calmly quiet, yet very busy at the same 
time.
An example of the separated bike lanes below, as well as what I mentioned before 
about the juxtaposition of fancy modern buildings and old pretty ones.

## Entertainment ##

There is no shortage of entertainment in Copenhagen. We didn't go, but they have 
the oldest amusement park in the world. There's also Christiania for the more 
free-spirited individuals. Several cool museums, gardens, and just in general 
biking around the city is great fun. If you want to take it easy, even lounging 
around is great because of how fast wifi is practically everywhere.
And don't even get me started about the night life. There's no shortage of bars 
and clubs and they're all open til very late. By far much more lively than 
Italy. Food is also open til those wee hours so if you crave some food after 
some hard raging, not a problem.

## People ##

Everyone spoke near-flawless English, and constantly apologized for how bad 
their English was. I don't even speak Dutch and I'm in your country... what...
People on average were very good looking and friendly.
Tourist destinations weren't crowded the way they were in Rome. I can deal with 
crowdedness in streets, I've been to China, but if I'm at a place trying to 
enjoy the sights and people are all up in my space, that's just not cool. 
GRAPH OF CROWDEDNESS-FUN

## Verdict ##

Yes. If you couldn't tell already from my fan girl tone, very much yes. I 
learned after my visit that this place is considered to be the happiest place on 
Earth and also the most underrated city in Europe. If I could make enough of a 
living there and my friends came with, I would move in a heartbeat.
We ended up extending our "quick stay" we loved it so much. I'm not going to 
write a post about Amsterdam. I don't mean to put down an entire city, but in my 
opinion it pretty much was just like Copenhagen's inbred cousin. It had similar 
appealing characteristics, but bike lanes crawled with too-fast mopeds that made 
the lanes no longer feel safe as well as made the place obnoxiously loud. Fine, 
Amsterdam has prostitutes. I'll give it that one.
