Growing up, I always had a vision of "the perfect life". The description of it 
changed as I did, but there was always something to continue to strive for that 
was out of reach.

That is, until it wasn't.

Now that I've graduated for over a year, I told myself that this is pretty much 
the life that I'll be living. I'm in beautiful California with my closest 
friends, making decent money. I have reasonable work hours at a fulfilling job, 
and flexibility to travel. It's everything I was going for in my latest 
iteration of my life concept. I had nothing further that I cared to attain.

Yet I was not content.

I began to find issue with the tech scene. The monoculture, the gentrification. 
I also saw problems with my work, and I even became jaded with traveling, seeing 
it as diminishing returns, talking to the same kinds of people no matter where I 
went. I felt like I had to move somewhere else, or do something different. I 
didn't know what, but this couldn't be it.

How could I feel like this? This is what I had worked so hard to get to. So many 
other people would love to have this kind of life. How could I justify not being 
perfectly happy with how things are?

As I talked to more and more people about their own life experiences, it became 
evident to me that there isn't really perfection, no matter how perfect what 
other people did looked on Facebook. Everything has a trade-off, sometimes it's 
just hard to see when we're on the other side. A lifestyle where you travel all 
the time can result in loneliness and instability. Having it easy on Tinder 
devalues love, making it harder to try at relationships.

And everyone has problems, regardless of their status and achievements.

There may be more consequential issues to be had, but from the point of view of 
the person experiencing the problems, they're just as tumultuous to face as any 
other. Other people's inner demons may look different from our own, but that 
doesn't mean they don't feel equally terrible to combat.

Maybe in the end that's ultimately what's common about being human, regardless 
of where we are in life. Dissatisfaction with our status quo. There's even a 
term in social psychology for this. Hedonic adaptation. When something great 
happens too frequently, we adjust our baseline happiness to it, and it no longer 
feels great.

So how can we escape this dissatisfaction? Will we never be happy with what 
we've got? I think by recognizing that there are downsides, we can adjust our 
expectations accordingly and get out of the vicious cycle. The unhappy feelings 
may still come, but we can accept them for what they are. It's simply part of 
being human to feel such a range of emotions.

That isn't to say that we shouldn't seek more. But to recognize that we have two 
choices at any given point. We can choose to accept, or we can choose to make a 
change. By seeing that we actually have two choices, we can selectively pursue 
more when appropriate, and see that sometimes things are okay as is.

So how do you decide when to do which? How do you balance ambition and 
acceptance?

Unfortunately that's still something I'm struggling with finding a heuristic 
for. The usual approach is to weigh the pros and cons and if the pros outweigh 
  the cons, accept it as it is. But often when we're chasing a dream, we don't 
  see the cons of that lifestyle, so of course it seems perfect and we make 
  changes towards it. And conversely, once we're in the "perfect life", it can 
  be easy to default to acceptance. We now see the cons, but it may seem like 
  accepting is the only viable solution. Since we don't know where and what to 
  change, it's not clear what the pros would be. It also takes inertia and 
  initial discomfort to get out of our comfort zone.

What am I choosing to do in my own situation right now? I guess I'm doing a mix 
of both. I'm accepting what I've got, both the good and bad. [The best parts of 
a culture are also its 
worst](https://markmanson.net/prove-yourself){:target="_blank"}, so as flawed as 
the Bay Area is, there are many perks that come with it, and I'm now noticing 
more of the good. And traveling the way I've always done it may be getting old 
for me, but there are other ways I can still experience other places, like 
  living there for longer periods of time to interact more with locals.

I'm still planning to make a change in my life, but it's not because I need it 
now, but because I'd like to try a change before I have real responsibilities 
and it becomes impossible to do so. A chance to explore what else is out there, 
to gain more empathy for others outside of our tech bubble.

Is this the right choice? I don't actually know. But you know what? That's okay! 
That's part of the beauty of living life. If we made perfect decisions and had 
perfect lives, life would be damn boring.

It's like sailing a boat, you set a direction to go and try to steer as close to 
it as possible, but sometimes winds will push you off course, and all you can do 
is adjust and adapt.
