Image of perfect life

Seemed to reach my perfect life, and yet I was still not content. How could this be? This is the life people had been telling me to achieve. How could I justify not being perfectly content with my life?

Everyone has a vision of a perfect life, and usually that perfect life is different than their own. But as it turns out, no one's life is actually perfect.

Even all stars (Michael phelps) struggle with problems. People with all the money struggle with problems. Sure, from the outside, you could argue those are not real problems or they're nice problems to have, but from that person's problems, their inner demons are just as torturous as anyone else's. 

Looking closer to home, friends who I thought had picture perfect lives on facebook or fairytale-like relationships on paper all had struggles of their own. Being single is liberating, but hard times can be tough to deal with. Being in a relationship is magical, but it takes a lot of work and compromise. Friends who had it easy with dating found that actually devalued love for them - it was hard to put in the effort in a relationship when an adequate replacement was a swipe away. 

As it turns out, everything has a downside. A lifestyle where you travel all the time can result in loneliness and instability. Having tons of money leads to all sorts of guilt and questioning of people's motives for being around you. 

Maybe in the end that's ultimately what's common about being human. Dissatisfaction with the status quo. As it turns out there's a term in social psychology for this. Hedonic adaption. When something great happens too frequently, we adjust our baseline happiness to it, and it no longer is something great.

To escape this dissatisfaction we have two choices - accept that everything has a downside and take it for what it is - being appreciative and grateful, or make a life change. How do you decide when to do what? The grass is always greener, but we still should have standards. So where do we draw the line?

Unfortunately that's still something I'm struggling with finding a heuristic for. The usual approach is to weigh the pros and cons and if the pros outweigh the cons, accept it as it is. But often when we're chasing a perfect life, we don't see the cons of that perfect life, so we blindly make changes towards it. And conversely, once we're in the "perfect life", it's hard to see what else is out there. We don't see
the pros of making a change because of the inertia and initial discomfort that comes from getting out of our comfort zone, so we think accepting is the only way to be happy.

But I think by recognizing that at any given point we have the two choices means I have more tools in my toolbelt for any occasion.

So where am I with my "perfect life"? I've been told to accept it, be grateful for what I've got, others are trying to get to where I am. But being here, and seeing the cons, I've personally decided to make a change. In the short term it may seem like I'm subjecting myself to unnecesary pain, and that might seem to not make any sense given the hard work it took to get where I am, but I need to explore the other possibilities. And I'm luckily privileged enough to be in a job market where even if
things go awry, I can likely return back to my comfort zone. 

Is this the right choice? I don't actually know. But you know what? That's okay! That's part of the beauty of living life. If we made perfect decisions all the time, life would be damn boring. If life is like sailing a boat, there will be winds that push us off course, and all we can do is steer our boat and try to head in the direction we choose.
