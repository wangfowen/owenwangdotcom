Since Ivy wrote about her [goals in 
leaving](https://medium.com/@ivyxvine/why-im-leaving-san-francisco-ff7b799473ea?fbclid=IwAR27IZejVrP7o3H8bmpCZhgH4YEUaVsCLYQo5_D7bmidPPsPcf-mWmMYTAA){:target="_blank"}, 
I've been told I need to explain myself as well so here we are.
The reality for why I'm doing this is because [I got 
fired](/blog/fired){:target="_blank"}. Or at least that's the direct catalyst. 
It's only been about a year and a half since I last came back from world 
travels, I honestly didn't think I'd go at it again so soon.

But this is not an escape from my problems. It's just a matter of timing.

What I mean by a matter of timing is that it just so happens that Ivy was also 
considering switching jobs when my circumstances changed, making this the 
closest possible chance where we could both uproot together.

Why uproot at all? Canadians have this thing called a working holiday visa where 
there's a list of countries they can work at for up to a year with minimal 
restrictions. The major requirement is said Canadian has to be under 30, so 
we're getting closer to that day by day. Minimal restrictions means I'm able to 
pursue something... different.

Cooking has been something that's crawled from being an interest to something 
taking up at least 1-2 nights of my time real estate per week. I've had the 
inkling of wanting to try it as a career, but I'm unable to with my visa 
situation in America -- in order to work in the US, I am constrained to tech, 
and I'm constrained to the company that sponsored my visa.
TALK MORE ABOUT WHAT INTERESTS ME ABOUT COOKING
So if I want to pursue cooking any further as a profession, I can't do it from America. The other option is to do it from Canada, but working holiday allows essentially the same freedom with the added benefit of I get to try living in different places.

Last time I went traveling with the intent of immersing myself in other 
cultures, to learn more about the world. I stayed in each place longer than I 
would for a vacation, trying to see more than just the typical tourist sights, 
but still essentially touring. I had gone through [a quarter life 
crisis](/blog/imperfection){:target="_blank"} and conceived of the idea during 
it, figured myself out without the traveling, but went anyways because a friend 
going on a similar adventure catalyzed me to do it.

This time I'm traveling with the intent of focusing on things I can't here. I 
intend to do very little touring, mostly trying to work wherever we are.

Last time was a pause from regularly scheduled programming. This time regularly 
scheduled programming will continue as before, but the prime time showing of 
Silicon Valley will now be replaced with Master Chef.

What do I plan to do with my time?
Try different areas of the food world -- wwoofing, work on a vineyard, work in a kitchen, take cooking classes, if anyone else has any other recommendations, shoot them our way.

What's the timeline?
As mentioned, ideally I'd be just rooted in one place, but Ivy and I have slightly different goals and hers are more fluid in place. We'll likely have some push and pull of staying longer in a place vs moving onto the next, but with all relationships, you compromise and find something that works for both of you :) there's no set timeline, we'll see where the wind takes us, and I'll try to find something that works for me wherever we are
So far we're planning on getting the New Zealand, Australia, and Japan working holiday visas, and we'll see where things go from there.
