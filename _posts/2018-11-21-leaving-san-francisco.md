Since Ivy wrote about her [goals in 
leaving](https://medium.com/@ivyxvine/why-im-leaving-san-francisco-ff7b799473ea?fbclid=IwAR27IZejVrP7o3H8bmpCZhgH4YEUaVsCLYQo5_D7bmidPPsPcf-mWmMYTAA){:target="_blank"}, 
I've been told I need to explain myself as well, so here we are.
The reality for why I'm doing this is because [I got 
fired](/blog/fired){:target="_blank"}. Or at least that's the direct catalyst. 
It's only been about a year and a half since I came back from a different bout 
of world travels, and we literally just signed a year lease that cost over 5k to 
break. Honestly I didn't really plan to leave again so soon.

But this is not an escape from my problems. It's just a matter of timing.

Ivy was also considering switching jobs when my circumstances changed. This 
meant we were both untethered work-wise, and since we were already packing for 
moving in together as well, this would likely be the best opportunity with the 
least friction for uprooting together while we're under 30.

_What makes 30 the magical number?_<br/>
There's this thing called a working holiday visa that Canadians have (other 
countries also have it in some form) that allows them to work and live elsewhere 
while they're under 30 for up to a year. The list of countries for the elsewhere 
  is [quite 
  long](https://www.creditwalk.ca/dear-nora-the-ultimate-working-holiday-visa-guide-for-canadians/){:target="_blank"}, 
  another wonderful perk of being Canadian ([sorry 
  Americans](https://www.gooverseas.com/blog/americans-guide-working-holiday-visas){:target="_blank"}).

_But why uproot at all? You're already living and working elsewhere aka 
America!_<br/>
The TN visa that allows me to be in America has a couple limitations:
1. I am tied to the company sponsoring my visa. I'm not allowed to make money in 
   any other form outside of my full-time job.
2. I am only allowed to work in the field I studied, which is tech.

I can stay in Canada to avoid these restrictions, but this is a limited time 
opportunity to do the same with the added bonus of trying living elsewhere.

What's appealing about living without these restrictions is I can try some 
things I wouldn't be able to otherwise. The primary one of these being exploring 
cooking as a career.

Cooking has been something that's crawled from being an interest to something 
taking up at least 1-2 nights of my time real estate per week. TALK MORE ABOUT 
WHAT INTERESTS ME ABOUT COOKING

With this opportunity I could see if anything in the hospitality industry 
interests me as a career &mdash; wwoofing, work on a vineyard, work in a 
kitchen, take cooking classes, if anyone else has any other recommendations, 
shoot them our way. Or at a minimum, my understanding of the food we consume 
and/or my cooking should improve, paying dividends down the line.

If the culinary world turns out to not be the right fit for me, then at least it 
won't be on the back of my mind anymore as an unexplored route. And other things 
I can try without the restrictions of the TN visa are doing part-time 
contracting to explore a lifestyle where work isn't everything, and/or try 
starting my own company.

Last time I went traveling with the intent of immersing myself in other 
cultures, to learn more about the world. I stayed in each place longer than I 
would for a vacation, trying to see more than just the typical tourist sights, 
but still essentially touring. I had gone through a quarter life crisis and 
conceived of the idea during it, [figured myself 
out](/blog/imperfection){:target="_blank"} without the traveling, but went 
anyways because a friend going on a similar adventure catalyzed me to do it.

This time I'm traveling with the intent of focusing on things I can't here. I 
intend to do little touring, mostly trying to work wherever we are.

Last time was a pause from regularly scheduled programming. This time regularly 
scheduled programming will continue as before, but the prime time showing of 
Silicon Valley will now be replaced with Master Chef.

_What's the timeline?_ <br/>
As mentioned, ideally I'd be just rooted in one place, but Ivy and I have slightly different goals and hers are more fluid in place. We'll likely have some push and pull of staying longer in a place vs moving onto the next, but with all relationships, you compromise and find something that works for both of you :) 

There's no set timeline, we'll see where the wind takes us, and I'll try to find 
something that works for me wherever we are. So far we're planning on getting 
the New Zealand, Australia, and Japan working holiday visas, and we'll see where 
things go from there. Let us know if you'd like to visit us somewhere! We'd love 
to see all your faces as we'll surely get tired of each other's after.
