I don't live for my work.
Made a list of things I want to try out in life, realized none of them related to my career.
Don't get me wrong, I love my work. I read about tech in my free time and it 
highly influences many of the other things I do. But I'm not one to passionately 
show off the things I've built, to discuss in length where and what I'm working 
on.
