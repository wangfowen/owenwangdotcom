I have a history of uprooting and moving. Usually it's due to circumstance, on 
occasion by choice. Most of the time I got to stick around long enough to make 
friends, but never really long enough to feel allegiance to any particular 
nation.

Whenever the open-ended question of my origins comes up, I gauge which answer 
would be most interesting to the asker -- China (my birth country), America 
(where my family resides), or Canada (where I go to school).  Canada generally 
prevails. I mean let's be honest, no one wants to admit they're from America 
except to other Americans. When people hear Canada they tend to respond with 
something along the lines of "I wish I could visit!". At this point I question 
their sanity in disbelief and get labeled as having anti-pride.  As much as I 
love the free health care and politeness, nothing about Canada particularly 
strikes me as extraordinary. Then again I'm not sure what exactly _would_ make a 
country exciting.

That's why when I travel to foreign lands, the back of my mind is always 
comparing them to my "homes". What's better / different about this place? What 
have I been taking for granted?

Some things do seem to be pretty constant no matter where in the world I go:

- Comic Sans in store signs. PSA: Please for the love of Taylor Swift cease 
doing this...
- American Billboard Top 40's playing in shops. "We Can't Stop" really doesn't 
ever stop
- The abominations known as pigeons polluting the streets
- McDonald's. Every other chain has a Bermuda Triangle, but not good ol' Mickey 
D's. The menus do vary from place to place but if it doesn't cost you a kidney 
in one way, it will another

And some things appear to be universal in most of Europe, but for whatever 
stupid reason is not in North America:

- Including tax in prices - Things actually cost what they're advertised to be! 
What a revolutionary idea
- Allowing people to drink in public - Some days you just want to kick back at 
the park with a nice cold one. Why is that a problem? The people who would be 
obnoxiously drunk on the streets are there regardless
- And of course, using the metric system!! Come on 'Murica

In this on-going series I will examine some of the cities I've stayed in and 
what I've experienced to be different about them, mostly looking at culture and 
urban design.  Perhaps doing this will help me find pride in somewhere. Or maybe 
I will discover a new place to call home!

The first city on the list: [Rome]({% post_url 2013-10-12-are-you-my-motherland-2 %}).
