##Are you unemotional?

I found out about my emotional challenge recently. I always thought I had a good understanding of people, where I could perceive their emotions. But somehow people still felt misunderstood around me. This is because even though I feel like I understand them, they don't feel that I do. This is because I suck at vocalizing to them that I do understand, that is, I suck at empathizing. I soon realized this stemmed from the fact that I actually don't know how to express my emotions. I first of all have very limited vocabulary for identifying the emotions that I'm feeling.

##Importance of empathy

Have you been in a situation where someone nags you or gives you unsolicited advice and you just tune them out?
Now, have you been in a situation where you feel like you're giving someone a quality solution to their problem, but then you feel misunderstood or ignored because they don't listen to you?

One of those scenarios is when you're on one side of the fence, and the other is the other side. This is what happens when there isn't empathy - you're just talking at each other. If you can empathize and fully understand their point of view, and express to them you've understood their point of view, then they're more receptive to coming to a solution.
This is important in both work place problem solving, as well as personal problem solving.

##How to empathy

Think of yourself in the other person's shoes. Don't just think of their point of view, and then refute it. Think about the emotions you'd feel if you were in their point of view, given their background. How does that feel? If it doesn't make sense to you, then you're not actually empathizing. Go off the assumption that they're logical, just with different logic than your own.
