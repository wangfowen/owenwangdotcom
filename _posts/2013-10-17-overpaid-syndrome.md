It's no secret that in this current day and age, people in technology make a 
decent living. What might not be as well known however is that interns are able 
to make a boat load also. This is at least the case in the Valley, I can't speak 
for the rest of the world. Depending on the company, some interns can make close 
  to six figures annually.

As a young adult in the industry, I am extremely grateful for these kinds of 
opportunities -- not just because it helps me pay my way through college but 
also because of the hands-on experience it grants me. At the same time though, 
my friends and I have developed what we call overpaid syndrome.

Overpaid syndrome is the embodiment of "yolo". Because our work is relatively 
low stress physically, we have nearly zero real world responsibilities as 
students, and we're not too concerned about finances (read: very lucky and 
spoiled), the weekends when we're not working overtime are completely free time. 
We can do whatever our hearts desire. If something that sounds exciting gets 
suggested, we'd have a group of people committed without a second thought. This 
has resulted in everything from a weekend bungee jumping outing to a week long 
Hawaii excursion.

When an idea is brought up, this is what goes through my head: I compute the 
number of hours I'd have to work to make up for the trip. If I deem that the 
adventure justifies the hours, I'm instantly down for it. Conversely, if I'm 
forced to do something I don't enjoy like shopping, I apply a similar mindset: 
I'll avoid this next time by doing it online or something. Sure it'll cost a bit 
more, but if I spend the hours that would be wasted looking for the best deal 
doing work instead, it'll make up for it. 3 hours working instead of shopping 
equals a lot of new clothes! 

Nevermind the fact that in the grand scheme of things I'm bleeding money 
unnecessarily, and that there's a limit to the amount I can actually work, and 
that those are imaginary future-hours that may not actually occur depending on 
the curve balls life throws at me. The thought process is totally flawless.

The syndrome is of course a huge generalization and doesn't apply to everyone. 
It does seem to be a trend within my tech social network though, and even some 
of our more frugal friends end up developing it after interning for a couple 
months.

It's terrible because I don't value money the way I was taught to growing up. 
Whenever I get out of California and return home to my first generation 
Chinese-American-Canadian household, I am reminded how that $500 ski trip 
could've bought just about every electronic device in the house, and how my 
parents didn't spend even a tenth of that when they were my age. It's sometimes 
good to have things put in perspective. I realize when I've been foolish and 
_too_ wasteful. Can't let overpaid syndrome justify _all_ my reckless spending.

But I wouldn't say overpaid syndrome is all bad. I find I no longer stress as 
much about the little things. That object I bought wasn't actually on sale? 
Whatever, no point arguing with the cashier. That's just another half hour of 
work. I spend more time on what actually matters to me -- exploring all the 
wonders the world has to offer and enjoying the companionship of my friends and 
family. Time is as much of a commodity as everything else. It is just as 
limited, and we only need to hoard so much wealth to be secure in ourselves. So 
if we have enough to be secure, why not live a little?

I leave you with this quote a friend once shared:

> Imagine there is a bank account that credits your account each morning with $86,400. It carries over no balance from day to day. Every evening the bank deletes whatever part of the balance you failed to use during the day. What would you do? Draw out every cent, of course? Each of us has such a bank. Its name is time. Every morning, it credits you with 86,400 seconds. Every night it writes off as lost, whatever of this you have failed to invest to a good purpose. It carries over no balance. It allows no over draft. Each day it opens a new account for you. Each night it burns the remains of the day. If you fail to use the day's deposits, the loss is yours. There is no drawing against "tomorrow". You must live in the present on today's deposits. Invest it so as to get from it the utmost in health, happiness and success. The clock is running. Make the most of today.
