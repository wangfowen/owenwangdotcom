        <ul>
          <p>
            I'm a full stack developer with over 12 years of cumulative work experience. 
            I've worked on a range of topics from <a href="#scale" class="find">designing scalable systems</a> 
            to <a href="#data" class="find">analyzing big data</a>, across big tech and early stage startups. 
            I'm proficient in Javascript (<a href="#react" class="find">React</a>, <a href="#typescript" class="find">Typescript</a>, Node, React Native), 
            Ruby (<a href="#rails" class="find">Rails</a>), <a href="#scala" class="find">Scala</a>, 
            <a href="#csharp" class="find">C#</a>. 
          </p>
          <p>Most of my career and passions have been centered around food. I'm currently investigating where software can be levered to make a social impact, for example to reduce the carbon emissions in our food supply chain or shift people to eat healthier.</p>
